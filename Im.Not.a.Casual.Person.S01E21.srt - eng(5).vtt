WEBVTT

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.759
I disagree.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.680
Mr. Cheng's abilities

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.560
are obvious to everyone.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400
Do you dare hand the company over to him?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.759
That's right.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.960
I don't agree either.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.280
None of us agree.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.360
But Mr. Cheng

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090
is Chairman Cheng's only heir.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.560
If you don't respect him,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.680
at least respect his father.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.000
This is business.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.810
It concerns all our interests.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.370
No one's face matters here.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.320
Mr. Cheng,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680
ask yourself honestly:

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.180
do you deserve this position?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.060
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.210
I admit my previous behavior was irresponsible.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.600
But that doesn't mean I'll continue to be this way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.260
The Cheng Group is everyone's hard work.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960
With all of your support,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.160
I will definitely manage the Cheng Group well.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.880
That's enough, young Mr. Cheng.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880
Words are useless.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.079
As for me,

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.440
I don't believe you.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.480
Let's do this, everyone.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.680
If you want to stay,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
stay a bit longer.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800
I'll take my leave now.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.520
Let's go.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.410
Let's go.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.730
Director Cheng.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.440
Director Cheng.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.160
The meeting isn't over yet.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.520
Where are you all going?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.079
Dad.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.520
What's the rush?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.240
Sit down.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.000
This seat is yours.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.620
No one can take it away.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.980
My son will take over my position.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.100
Is there a problem?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.800
Hey.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.840
I've worked with Shen Yifan's PR team

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.480
to develop five contingency plans.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.120
No matter what they release today,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.240
we have ways to counter it.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.000
Got it.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.160
Even if the sky falls,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.700
I, Yu Youyi, will be there to support her.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.180
Holy crap! They really posted it.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.040
Wait, wait.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.560
Something's not right.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560
What's not right?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.519
Bro,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.320
that's not Zheng Ying and Mr. Shen.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.880
What?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.970
Who else could it be?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640
It's Ni Hao.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.040
He climbed up the stairs with his camera to take photos today.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.000
Then I accidentally fell down.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.520
This...

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.320
How did this

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.480
gossip end up involving me?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.000
That's ridiculous!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440
How could Ni Shang fall for him?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.360
Isn't he the director who caused his junior's death?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.400
Can't my sister have

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.880
better taste in men?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.280
I'm sorry.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.280
You got dragged into this again.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.000
At least they didn't photograph Ni Hao.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.720
Now all attention

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.300
will be focused on you.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.160
So it's better not to let Ni Hao

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.420
live with you anymore.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.120
Sister, can you let me stay with you?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.320
I'm sorry, but no.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.280
I'm used to sleeping alone.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.160
Besides,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.620
I need to wake up early for filming tomorrow.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560
It's understandable when children lie.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.760
But when adults do, it's unforgivable.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
Isn't tomorrow the filming of Ni Shang and Wan Yuchen's

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.760
big capture scene?

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.690
You have a day off tomorrow.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.159
Why are you lying to the child?

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.920
You're shameless.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.200
I'm shameless?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.920
You're the one pushing your own mess onto me.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.640
Making me worry and fear,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.900
even causing issues between me and Shen.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.320
Anyway,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.280
you're the shameless one.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.720
Sister, I'm cold.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880
You clever little thing.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.760
Come on in.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.440
Good night, Dad.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560
I'll leave the child with you.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.360
I'm going now.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.280
Wait.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.020
Let's have a moment of honesty before you go.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.050
A talented graduate from the Film Academy's cinematography department.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.810
Documentaries winning numerous awards abroad.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.290
The most promising new-generation documentary director.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.880
That was before.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.920
No wonder the comic leak mentioned

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.180
a mysterious man with a double identity.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.560
So you went from documentary director

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.620
to suddenly becoming a talent agent.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.360
Tell me,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
being by my side,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.800
are you on some secret mission?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.000
I just...

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.960
I ran out of creativity

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.720
and changed careers to make a living.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.480
What's with that look?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.480
This is my 'I don't believe a word you're saying' face.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.120
Dad,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.000
you know how to film?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.200
Why did you stop?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.000
Is he asleep?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.440
We weren't the ones who leaked it.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.120
I'm sorry.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.210
No, wait.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.890
Why should I apologize?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.880
Even if we weren't the ones who leaked it,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.000
it doesn't change the fact

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200
that he wants to deny our relationship.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.560
Time to sleep.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.240
Zhuo Hao.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.560
Set up the tripod over there first.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.320
Later this evening,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.800
we'll shoot a sunset time-lapse.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.640
I'll shoot here for a while.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.200
Okay.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.320
Senior.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.200
Haozi.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.360
My son.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.200
Give me back my Zhuo Hao.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.320
Give him back to me.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.640
My son.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.960
Return Zhuo Hao to me.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.040
Give me back my son.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.170
Let's go.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.330
Come with me.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.320
You can't watch anymore.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.240
Zhuo Hao is gone.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.770
Let's go.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.460
Morning, Nishang.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.450
Morning.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.600
Um,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.120
is Youyi

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.380
not here today?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.320
He's your agent.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.280
Why are you asking me?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.280
You're right.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720
I guess he's not here.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.040
These netizens

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.240
are something else.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.640
They all think they're

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.100
archaeological experts.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.480
They dig up all those

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.210
ancient, irrelevant matters.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.130
Don't insult archaeologists.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.120
Archaeologists restore history,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.380
while some internet users fabricate it.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.120
So,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.240
those rumors claiming Brother Friendship killed

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.600
his fellow disciple out of jealousy

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.000
are completely false.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.840
Right?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.370
Do you believe that?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.760
Of course I don't.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.160
But

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.040
many people online already believe it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.460
He hasn't wronged anyone.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.480
Please stop these malicious attacks.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.240
Oh my!

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.760
This is huge drama!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.760
Miss Zheng Ying,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.160
your breakfast is ready.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.100
This is for you.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.120
10 o'clock at the park campsite.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.400
Be there or be square.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.440
You think I'll just go because you say so?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.300
That would make me look pathetic.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.240
Ni Hao kept insisting on coming,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.900
so I had to bring her along.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.660
Sorry for the trouble.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.460
Come on,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.760
isn't this fun?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.000
Sister, the trees here are so tall!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.800
And there's a stream over there.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.160
Yes,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.560
and there's also a big pond over there

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.880
with lots and lots of fish.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.520
Sister, I'm so glad you decided to come after all,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.920
or I would have missed seeing all this.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.520
Well, you wanted to come,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.400
so I had to agree.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.480
How about Uncle Wu Yu takes you to see the fish?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.000
Okay.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.520
Let's go.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.160
Come with me to see the fish.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.600
Off we go.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.520
Let's go.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.720
Let's keep some distance.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.160
If someone takes photos of us,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.560
it would be such a hassle.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.660
What are you doing?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.880
Making amends.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.300
Providing personal service.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.760
Who needs it?

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.480
Whether you want it or not, I'm doing it.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.440
You don't have to be literally this close.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.370
How can it be personal service if I'm not close to you?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.360
We're out of coffee.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.600
Coming.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.080
Coming.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.520
What's wrong?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960
Doesn't taste good?

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.680
It's fine.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.880
Just a bit hot.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.580
Are you still mad at me?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.240
It'll take three pork trotters,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.360
ten chicken feet,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.720
and a hundred bags of snacks

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.980
to make me feel better.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.480
No problem.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.880
Luckily I came prepared.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.720
Just wait.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.680
How are you? Are you okay?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.240
I'm fine.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.650
You should rest. I can handle this.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.480
I'm actually really good at barbecuing.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.880
My grandfather is from Jinzhou, after all.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.850
No need. Let me do it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.920
Go wash your face in the bathroom first,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.450
then we can grill together.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.940
Alright. Wait for me then.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.480
Wait for me, okay?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.360
Got it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.200
What's wrong, Ni Hao?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.720
Weren't you looking at the fish?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.780
Why are you crying?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.440
Did Wu Yu bully you?

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.240
How would I dare to bully him?

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.970
I took Ni Hao to play over there,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.460
and some kid seems to have broken his camera.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.480
Where's my little boss Shen?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.050
He went to the bathroom.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680
Then I'll leave him with you for now.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.160
I'll go find my boss Shen.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.560
Be good.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.680
I took so many photos.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.600
Are they all gone now?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.080
I wanted to show them to my parents.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.490
Let me look for them.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.240
Look.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.560
Are these all the ones you took?

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.200
Yes.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.210
If I go public with this.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.720
Then for her entire life,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.200
she'll be labeled as Shen Yifan's woman.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.960
That label.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.480
She won't be allowed to have any happiness.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.970
Otherwise people will say,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.490
'Shen Yifan is dead,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.980
how can you still be smiling?'

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.730
She especially can't have any romantic relationships.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.260
She would have to live under everyone's scrutiny and supervision

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.210
for the rest of her life.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.600
I found her

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.780
because I wanted to help her succeed,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.960
to help her become the best version of herself.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.800
I couldn't be with her while I was alive,

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.520
and I certainly can't

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.680
become her shackle after death.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.400
Sister, why are you crying?

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.000
I'm here.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.760
What's wrong?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.760
It's nothing.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.280
The smoke is irritating my eyes.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.040
Let's stop grilling.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.480
He bought the charcoal,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.810
let him do the grilling.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:40.890
Let's go.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.210
Let's go.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.050
Let's go. I'll hold your hand on this side.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.400
Slow down. Slow down.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.960
Are you cold?

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.080
What's wrong?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.680
Mr. Shen.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.640
We were photographed today.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.100
We weren't that intimate.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.640
We can still deny it.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.200
Right?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.500
I'll handle it.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.100
Don't worry too much about it.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.480
My agent said

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.240
I'm at a rising point in my career.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.680
Maintaining a single status

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.480
would be better for me anyway.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.520
I understand.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.920
[Symbols]

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.260
Does it have to be this way?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.000
Employee.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.690
You're home.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.640
Thank you for driving me home, boss.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.960
Well, I...

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.360
Didn't you say

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.560
we should keep our distance?

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.960
Who said I wanted to keep distance from you?

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:09.880
What?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.580
Do you want to keep your distance from me?

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.960
No.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.880
By the way,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.680
when are you going back to Switzerland?

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.450
Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock flight.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:49.960
Hey,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.280
Youyi.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.340
Do I have any scenes tomorrow?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.200
Nothing during the day.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.800
There's a night shoot in the evening.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.860
You don't need to rush back to the set.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.040
What?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.580
Are you going to see me off?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.760
Shen Yifan,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.760
let's go on a date

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.320
tomorrow.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.460
Where's Cheng Moyang?

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.140
Where's Cheng Moyang?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120
Looking for me?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.120
I want a drink.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.240
I never thought Director Cheng, who's been so high and mighty all his life,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.570
would one day have to beg me for something.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.570
You little brat!

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.120
I'm not dead yet,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.980
and you dare...

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.050
Director Cheng,

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.530
if you want to hit me or curse me,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.680
you'll have to stand up first,

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.600
right?

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.560
I...

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.080
Mr. Cheng, what should we do?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.400
The chairman insists on refusing treatment.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.560
You're a doctor and I'm a doctor.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.840
Why are you asking me what to do?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.640
I don't care what methods you use.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.720
Just cure him.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.780
Do you understand?

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.740
What's wrong with you?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.600
If you're afraid to make your relationship public,

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.360
why be together in the first place?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.400
And if you've chosen to be together,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.130
why are you afraid to go public?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.080
You think because you're sick,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.640
you can do whatever you want?

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.100
Making others pay for your mistakes, right?

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.880
You're not a real man.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.600
Mr. Shen.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.580
Since we have a date tomorrow,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.080
to save time,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.580
should we prepare something in advance?

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880
It's just one day,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.080
so what if we waste it,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.800
let's do whatever she wants.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.360
We only have one day,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.560
what should we do?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.280
Matching outfits?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.480
It's too late to order those now.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.520
Revolving restaurant?

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.080
Revolving restaurant...

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.940
They only have tables after 9 p.m.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.120
Experience a lifetime in one day.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.680
Yifan,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.960
there are so many things I want to do with you in this lifetime,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.080
but we might not have enough time.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.440
So let's use this one day

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.100
to live out our entire life together.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.640
Mr. Shen, you're awake.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.240
As you instructed,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.440
I haven't scheduled any work for today.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.080
So this is what it feels like

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.400
to idle away time.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.050
Why are you here?

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.840
Shen Yifan.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.010
Why did you misplace your wedding ring again?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.400
As a married person,

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.080
didn't I tell you

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.440
that wedding rings

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.720
must never be lost?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.400
Alright,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.200
Mrs. Shen,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.500
I was wrong.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.040
Since your attitude is good,

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.480
I'll forgive you this time.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.200
But don't let it happen again.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.700
It won't happen again.
