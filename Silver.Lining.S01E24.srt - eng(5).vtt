00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.320
It's okay.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.200
Don't stress.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.319
Anyway,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.690
if their purpose for doing this

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.640
is to trigger your memory recovery,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.170
they must have other plans.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000
No matter what happens in the future,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520
no matter what the truth is,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.320
don't worry,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.410
I'm here for you.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.240
And all the guys in our team

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.080
will bear this together.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.600
Thank you,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.360
Captain Luo.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.479
Captain Luo,

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.210
Officer Chi.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.009
Officer Chi.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.240
Are you both

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.039
all right?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.440
I couldn't reach you by phone.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.120
I came here

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.360
and just found out you're in the hospital too.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.720
Why aren't you chasing after Tu Guolin?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.960
What are you doing at the hospital?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.960
Something happened.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.680
Tu Guolin was poisoned in an assassination attempt.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.960
Fortunately, we got there in time.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.560
He's now

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.759
being treated in the operating room.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.600
Who did it?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.720
Did you catch them?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.759
No idea at all.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.380
Tu Guolin was hiding in a residential house.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.760
The guy who brought him food

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.200
He was most likely being used.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.960
He didn't even know

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.680
how they switched his food.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.039
Stop investigating.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.759
You won't find anything.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.800
When you found Tu Guolin,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.080
did you make any other discoveries?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.240
Everything he brought

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280
was just ordinary daily necessities.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.410
If I had to point out anything unusual,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.680
we found

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.400
a partially carved

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.200
wooden cat in his briefcase.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.460
There was also a small carving knife inside.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.650
A carving knife?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.160
What kind of carving knife?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.560
Yes.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.760
The evidence is here.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.600
Take a look.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.890
It's a U-shaped carving knife.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.400
Fortunately, he was brought in on time.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.200
The patient is out of danger now.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.640
However, the toxins in his blood

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.960
will take some time to be completely eliminated.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.720
He'll probably remain unconscious for quite a while.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.320
Did you hear me?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.960
Chi Xia,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.690
even if you go now, you won't be able to wake him up.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.480
That's right.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.960
Only these calluses and scars

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.090
come from holding a carving knife for a long time.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
How does this relate

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.329
to what happened to him?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.600
Captain Luo,

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.640
I strongly suspect

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.920
he's the real murderer who killed my parents.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.200
I'll go back and pack right away.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.360
I'll make some calls.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.160
We'll transfer Tu Guolin tonight

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.890
to Dongzhou Central Hospital.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.780
What are you doing?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.520
You're awake.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.560
Why didn't you wake me up?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.760
You were sleeping so soundly.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.640
And I didn't know if you'd be grumpy when woken up.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.440
If I woke you up

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.500
and made you angry,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.560
what if you complained to Director Chang that I was bullying team members?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.320
Well, I'm awake now anyway.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680
Then I apologize.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.970
How will you make it up to me?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.850
When I was passing by here earlier,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.680
I saw those seagulls.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.500
My mind suddenly went blank for a moment.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.340
I remembered the times

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.560
when I went to my countryside home.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.720
My sister and I would feed pigeons in the evening.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.680
Not seagulls.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.720
Back then,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.860
the flock of pigeons would circle in the sky.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240
When the sunset glow shined on them.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640
It was beautiful.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.570
Too bad I'll never see it again.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.850
You're thinking about your sister again.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.440
Luo Xun

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.370
Why are you here?

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.480
Master.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240
I've seen the autopsy report.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.320
The way my sister died

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.640
matches the previous serial killings

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.360
exactly how those victims died.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.890
And the timing lines up too.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.920
I think we should investigate them together.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.120
Why are you closing the case now?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.320
Come, let me tell you.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.520
Listen to me.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.130
The puncture wounds on Xiaofei's body

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.520
compared to the other victims

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.760
have many inconsistencies.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.240
It looks more like

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.400
a copycat crime.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.140
I understand how you feel,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.960
but don't be too anxious.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.760
Master,

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.240
are you just trying to avoid suspicion?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.770
All the victims are young, attractive women.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.360
The distribution of puncture wounds

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.040
also has distinctive patterns.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.680
Especially in areas with sexual connotations,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.810
the punctures are more concentrated.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.480
But none of these victims

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.120
were sexually assaulted.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.360
Can I reasonably suspect that

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760
the killer is someone with

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.800
sexual dysfunction and a puncture fetish?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.400
Even if it's a copycat crime,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.080
as long as the criminal characteristics are similar,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.120
he must be the one.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.520
Why can't we intensify the investigation?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.240
Enough.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.360
Am I in charge of this case or are you?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.960
Do I need you to remind me?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.080
The case I assigned you,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.340
have you solved it yet?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.920
Just focus on your own work

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.980
and that's enough.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.400
No.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960
You've been acting strange lately.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.050
Your emotions have never been this unstable before.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.320
Master.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.880
She also calls you Master.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.920
Precisely because she calls me Master,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.000
don't you think

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.020
I feel heartbroken about what she went through?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.450
I was thinking at that time.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.880
No matter what,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.850
I had to investigate it myself.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.560
That night,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.000
If it wasn't because of me

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.200
leaving her alone in the office,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.160
she wouldn't have gone out

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.340
to investigate a lead by herself.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.120
In the end,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.720
I just can't get over this guilt.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.340
But you still figured it out, didn't you?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.760
Yes.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
I did.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.760
I never really understood it.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.930
I couldn't let it go for a long time.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.840
I couldn't forgive him either.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.680
But recently,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.900
I've started to accept it gradually.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.680
The bond between father and son is deep.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.409
My mentor felt that way about his son Zheng Yanbo.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.080
I feel the same about my sister Luo Lingfei.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.280
Even you,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.400
Chi Xia,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.680
You're so determined about your adoptive parents' case.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.720
Isn't it because

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.890
family bonds can't be severed?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.800
We're all the same.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.960
My mentor,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.370
He was wrong, plain and simple.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.520
For this,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.530
the law will punish him.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.690
Morality will condemn him.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.080
As someone

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.620
who was a police officer with high moral standards,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.440
the moment he chose to cover up a crime,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.659
I don't believe he wasn't tormented inside.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.570
I won't forgive him.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.680
But I won't hate him anymore either.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.640
Captain Luo.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.850
Don't force yourself to face the past.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.440
Even when a wound heals,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.610
the scar still needs time to fade, doesn't it?

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.300
Since it's not the right time,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.680
just wait until

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.680
the day you can talk about it calmly.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.500
Whenever you want to talk,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.500
I'll be here to listen.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.610
You've forgiven yourself.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.360
That's good.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.320
Alright.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.920
Let's move on.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.560
Yu Ji's case.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.480
You two really had me worried.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.000
What did you promise me on the phone?

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.200
Chief Chang.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.640
Didn't I bring this person back safely?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.480
Yes.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.200
Chief Chang,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.640
we had a close call this time,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.480
but next time when we're better prepared,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.360
we'll definitely succeed.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.160
Next time?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
If there's a next time,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.080
I'll transfer both of you to the PR department.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.960
Alright.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.290
Let's get down to business.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.480
What's the latest

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200
on Yu Ji's case?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.560
Everything that needs to be transferred

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.680
to the prosecutor's office

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.140
is proceeding as planned.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.880
The local suspects involved in the fighting

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880
and assaulting officers are being arrested.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.400
The explosion analysis at Bailong Resort

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.560
has been completed.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.240
There are no leads to follow.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.200
However,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.000
fortunately it happened in an abandoned building

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.400
deep in the mountains.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.920
No civilians were injured.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.320
So the negative impact

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.280
hasn't spread.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.480
But Chief Chang,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.360
I think these people

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.840
still need to be investigated.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.800
If next time they set something off in a crowded area,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.060
I won't even make it to the PR department.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.000
The Fox has gone into hiding again.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.360
Taking all her people with her

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.920
as if they've vanished into thin air.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.120
But that's okay.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.960
As long as she appears,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.200
she'll leave traces.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.240
Sooner or later,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.480
we'll catch her.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.120
Comrades,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.360
I won't give you that motivational speech

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.720
about staying extra vigilant.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.120
I know

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.480
you're all working very hard.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.280
But

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.280
you can't let your guard down,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.080
nor can you relax your vigilance.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.160
Is that clear?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.520
Absolutely clear.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.840
Good.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.100
The New Year is coming.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.040
There are no major cases at the moment.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.760
Everyone go home and get some rest

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.800
to recharge.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.380
I'm waiting for you all

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400
to bring me good news about winning this tough battle.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.480
Yes.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.800
Officer Chi.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.520
Officer Chi.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.480
I came specifically to tell you

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.120
that our shop

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.840
will be open until the 29th of the lunar month

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.320
and will reopen on the 7th.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.740
Mr. Qu specifically asked me to give this to you.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.000
Where has Qu Bai been lately?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.040
I can't reach him.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.760
Mr. Qu went to the mountains to research a project.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.490
The signal might be poor there.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.680
Alright.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.760
Thank you.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.560
I'm leaving.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.800
Bye-bye.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.920
Mr. K.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880
The clouds are quite thick tonight.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.760
I could see a few stars just now,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.240
but now I can't see any.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.420
Starlight indeed cannot penetrate the clouds,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.700
just like everyone in the company

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.200
must follow your orders.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.640
Are you saying I'm

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040
all-powerful?

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320
I'm sorry, Mr. K.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320
I know I was wrong.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.080
I'll follow all your orders.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.160
Tell me.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.680
Does the law only protect victims?

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.880
What do you mean?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.160
Go now.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.420
I won't disappoint you again.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
It doesn't matter if I'm disappointed.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.200
He's the one

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.540
who's truly disappointed in you.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.330
K is waiting for you.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.800
Coming.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.730
You're always so reliable.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520
All these years,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.650
you've never disappointed me.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.520
You're too kind.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.460
I'm just doing my best.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.360
You asked me to come here.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.420
Is there another assignment?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.330
Don't always talk about assignments.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.080
In your eyes,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.130
am I really that cold-hearted?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.600
Not at all.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.080
I called you back from China this time

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.960
because I want you to spend New Year with me.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.200
Those who can chat with me about everyday matters,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.360
besides those two,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.740
there's only you left.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.040
Drink slowly.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.540
I just added hot water.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.400
If you drink tea too hastily,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.540
burning your tongue is a minor issue,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.420
but if you swallow such hot water,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.290
it could damage your internal organs.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.400
Indeed, some things

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.700
are better learned

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720
from others

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.610
than through self-discovery.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.200
Do you still remember

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.360
everything I taught you?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600
I wouldn't dare forget for a moment.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.860
I'm well aware of what Chi Xiao is doing on the mainland.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.370
Whether it succeeds or fails, I'll make my own judgment.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.640
But given your position,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.490
there are some matters you should be involved in,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.600
and others you should stay away from.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.280
This is for the bigger picture.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.540
Water has a boiling point.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.200
People have principles.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.280
Don't cross the line.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.000
I understand.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.440
If you don't drink it soon,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440
it will get cold.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.620
Almost.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.890
In the year I turned twelve.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.120
What really happened?

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.440
In this world,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.840
it's all about who dares

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.480
to go further than others.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.040
But my parents,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.640
they underestimated me.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.320
As long as I can catch the killer with my own hands,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.720
I'm willing to die for it.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.320
Ready?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.360
Let's try.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.080
What happened to your hand?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.520
I've fantasized countless times

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.650
about dying together with him.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.700
Trying to save my life now,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.060
isn't it a bit too late?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.400
The victim's body contains nerve-paralyzing drugs.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.060
If my speculation is correct,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.720
this should be a premeditated murder.
