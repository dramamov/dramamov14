00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.360
Hello.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.170
Let me reintroduce myself.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.240
I'm the chairman of Yiping Sunshine,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.040
Cheng Moyang.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.520
So,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.420
what brings Chairman Cheng to my company today?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.920
Although I've always admired Miss Zheng Ying

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.720
and never given up pursuing you,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.840
it's work hours now,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so I'm naturally here for business.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.120
This book is exceptionally well-written.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.380
I think the author is an absolute genius.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.400
I've noticed this novel before.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.720
It's indeed well-written.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.240
Being able to write a love story without being sappy

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.920
is quite rare.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.360
Yes,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.320
and when reading it,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.280
I had this strange sense of familiarity.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.000
As if it happened around me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
Exactly.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.280
When I saw the characters,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.560
I felt like I was seeing myself.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.280
You know,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.200
I also had a feeling

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.360
of being watched.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.600
So with a resource like this,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.120
if we just leave it alone,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.520
wouldn't that be a waste?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.040
It would certainly be a crime.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.840
What if we buy the rights?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040
We could have a script ready in three months.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.320
We could film it in four months,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.000
barring any issues.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.930
It could be released within a year.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480
What do you think?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.480
I think

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.320
these rights aren't something you can just buy outright.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.120
Shouldn't we try contacting the author first?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.300
So I'm here contacting you now, aren't I?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.120
How did you know?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600
So you're not planning to come back?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.260
She's always wanted to create a good story herself.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.320
Actually, her writing is quite good,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.520
and she has particularly innovative ideas.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.720
She's currently online

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780
serializing a novel about our story.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.730
The content is really good.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.440
It's excellent original IP.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.400
You could reach out to her

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.800
and develop it together.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.320
Although I really like Zhengying,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320
when it comes to projects,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.760
I still need to think it through carefully.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760
After all, you know

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.320
developing a project requires significant funding.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.000
I had Wu Yu establish a fund

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.360
that only invests in projects she's involved with.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.560
The money in it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.520
is enough to buy all the projects she likes.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.880
Got it.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.160
Her personality is somewhat impulsive.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.820
When you're friends with her,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.120
please be more patient with her.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.100
She gets into character quickly,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.370
but takes time to snap out of it.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.700
You need to be aware of this issue.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.320
She always practices martial arts right after meals without resting.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.980
Please remind her about this.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.130
She listens to you the most.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.720
I don't like Shen Yifan.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.600
But he desperately wants

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.760
to pave your entire life's path for you.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.640
For this,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.440
I admire him.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000
He was very restrained when he approached me.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.159
His tone was casual.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.480
But the more effort he put into restraining himself,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.540
the more I realized

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.100
how overwhelming his love for you is.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280
Shen Yifan.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.360
Why did you leave notes for everyone else

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.800
but not for me?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.960
Why?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.840
Let me take a photo of you too.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.400
I don't like having my photo taken.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.840
Who doesn't like having their photo taken?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.159
Skinny, hurry up.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:59.280
Come on!

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.640
Ready?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.520
All set!

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040
Long time no see,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400
The two of us

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.090
really don't belong to the same world.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600
But between you and me,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600
there was once a little connection.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.960
You said.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.680
Once I put on the headphones,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.800
you would immediately

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.460
take care of everything else.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.640
Oh my God!

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.960
The famous star Zheng Ying.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.720
Is that really Zheng Ying?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.440
Yes, it's her. The famous star Zheng Ying.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.040
No way.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.200
Could it be someone impersonating Zheng Ying?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.000
That's right.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.200
I am Zheng Ying.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.370
I'm the one who starred in 'Duel of Beauties'.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.100
And 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.920
Zheng Ying, an actress who has trended many times online.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.640
Zheng Ying, I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.160
Could you sign an autograph for me?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.560
Didn't you say that whenever I'm in danger,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.300
you would immediately appear and take control?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.680
I'm in danger right now.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.440
Where are you?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.760
Where are you?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.520
Shen Yifan,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.520
show yourself!

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.280
Shen Yifan!

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.400
Shen Yifan!

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.600
What are you doing?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.960
Shen Yifan,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.240
is that you?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.040
I'm back.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.200
When I ask you something,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.720
you need to answer honestly.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.520
Understand?

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320
I understand.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.360
Leniency for those who confess,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.960
severity for those who resist.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.000
I know the rules.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.970
After you arrived in Switzerland,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.400
what happened?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.860
When I got to Switzerland,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.480
I scheduled surgery,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760
then had the operation,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.040
followed by post-op treatment,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.800
recovery,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.880
rehabilitation,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.080
MACYMCC, that's all.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.320
That's it?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.760
Of course.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.040
Then why did you send me

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.440
those kinds of messages?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.920
I was just...

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.240
Maybe because

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.640
I was too bored

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.170
and wanted to joke with you.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.640
Should you send messages like that so casually?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.760
Is that kind of information something to joke about?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.440
Shen Yifan.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.120
I can't handle being startled.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.920
What's wrong?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.040
Are you having heart problems?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.840
Let me see.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.360
I'm fine.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.420
I was just kidding.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.760
Shen Yifan!

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.640
How dare you trick me!

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.000
I'm sorry!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.400
How dare you lie to me?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.520
Lying to me? I'll teach you a lesson!

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.320
I'm really sorry.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.080
You're so annoying.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.480
You're driving me crazy.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.200
Are you sure you want to be like this?

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.400
Just do your own thing.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.930
I'm not getting in your way.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.920
What are we eating today?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680
Today?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.040
All your favorites.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.800
There's a casual project meeting today.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800
Aren't you going?

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.760
Today...

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.480
I'm not working.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.440
So what are we going to do?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.810
I have more important things to do.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840
So this is what you call important?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.240
Just wasting time

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.370
and fooling around.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.200
I used to be in such a hurry.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.400
Always focused on efficiency

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.930
and never wasting a minute.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.530
But now it's different.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.160
Now I have plenty of time

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.400
to enjoy life.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.360
Besides,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
having fun

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480
can hardly be called a waste of time.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.800
Why aren't you working today?

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.260
What are you doing?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.300
[Naming future children]

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.760
What are you doing?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.360
Knitting a hat for a dog.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.800
Shen Yifan,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.120
we don't even have a dog.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.960
It's almost midnight.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.680
You used to go to bed at midnight sharp.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.340
It's almost midnight.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.880
Shouldn't we get some

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200
spicy hot pot?

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.200
Let's go.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.960
How about that? Pretty impressive, right?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.480
Finally.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.890
I've finally freed myself.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800
Wan Yuchen.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.040
Yuchen.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.560
Wan Yuchen.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.640
Ni Shang.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.840
Are you ready?

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.040
This is my first time

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.100
walking the red carpet as a director.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.480
I mean,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.320
are you ready to be Ni Hao's real father?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.890
I've been ready for a long time.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960
Ni Shang.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.880
Come on! Come on!

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.760
Zheng Ying.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.700
I invited them here

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.440
to witness your moment of glory.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.040
I won't waste my time

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.240
caring about those

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.000
who are far behind me.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.680
Such people

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.900
don't even qualify as opponents.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.160
Let's go.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.440
Mr. Cheng.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.960
I don't need your help with this.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.120
Let's go.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.000
You look beautiful today.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.160
Next up

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.560
is definitely a moment worth remembering.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.880
Please welcome award-winning actress Ni Shang

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880
to present

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.680
the Most Popular Actress Award.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.240
The winner of the Most Popular Actress Award is

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.839
the actress who played Shan Lan in 'Drunken Jade Mountain,'

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.760
Zheng Ying.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.359
Congratulations.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.280
You did it.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.500
You took the trophy from my hands.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.920
I'm not someone who makes empty promises.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.640
Come on.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.480
Hello everyone.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.040
I'm actress Zheng Ying.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.880
I'm honored to receive this award

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.140
for my role as Shan Lan.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.400
First,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.680
I want to thank my mentor,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.000
Zhou Zheng.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.960
He once led an era

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280
and gave me a role model to aspire to.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.280
He was also

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.800
my inspiration

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.850
to become a martial arts actor.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.040
Next,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.280
I want to thank

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.280
my agent who has always protected me

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.960
and my friends who have always been by my side.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.320
They taught me

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.080
Only by standing tall through our own efforts

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.440
can we earn achievements and respect.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.520
This award

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.980
doesn't just belong to me,

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.600
but to everyone in the production team.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.560
Thank you all

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.260
for making this possible.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.720
I would like to offer

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.320
my deepest respect to everyone.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.840
And I hope all my colleagues in the industry

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.960
will pursue their dreams with joy throughout life,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.800
without fear

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.090
and without regret.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.280
Finally,

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.330
I want to thank one more person.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.240
You left letters for everyone,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.280
except for me.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.800
But

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.360
I choose to forgive you generously.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.880
Because I know

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.170
you've been quietly warming my heart.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.480
Protecting me.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.520
You wished

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.580
to bring the whole world to me just to fulfill my dreams.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.320
It turns out our fate

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.980
began more than ten years ago.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.200
It had already started.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.120
That afternoon,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.120
the sunlight was gentle,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.920
you were so adorable.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.960
Our little bodies held each other's hands.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.490
Little did we know we were making a lifelong promise.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.400
Shen Yifan,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600
perhaps

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.580
you were an unexpected encounter in my life,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.200
but you are my

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800
forever.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.160
My only joy.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.000
You said you hoped that someday

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.960
you would return safe and sound.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.640
To see me standing tall

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.240
in the brilliant spotlight.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.760
Soaring high.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.940
No one could bully me anymore.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.480
Shen Yifan.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.200
Can you see how I'm shining now?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.440
If only

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.680
you were here too.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.920
Yes.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.880
I've finally fulfilled your wish

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.240
and seen the most beautiful scenery.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.280
It's just a pity

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.160
that the person who should be enjoying this splendor with me isn't here.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.680
I'm someone who doesn't like to leave any regrets.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.800
But this time,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.520
I seem to have failed.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.000
We've found a heart donor.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.060
What are you waiting for? Go quickly.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.640
Mr. Shen has a strong will

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.640
and is recovering well.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.320
But he still needs proper care

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.650
to recover even better.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.440
I understand.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.960
Thank you, doctor.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.320
Mr. Shen,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.880
you can't leave me behind and go back to China alone.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.360
No matter what you say, I'm coming with you.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.320
I'm not leaving you behind.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.040
I'll go first

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.170
and come back for you once I'm settled.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.980
How soon is 'soon'?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720
You just had surgery.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.000
You need to rest properly.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.760
Shen Yifan,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760
let me tell you,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760
without my...

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.800
I won't go, I won't go.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.480
Okay?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.280
I'm not going.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.000
Without my permission,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.930
don't come back.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.480
Live well back home

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.560
and enjoy everything to the fullest.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.760
Most importantly,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.490
don't let Zheng Ying bully you.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.560
What are you standing there for?

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.520
Before I change my mind,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.680
get in the car quickly.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.280
I'll take you to the airport.
