00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.600
Zheng

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200
Mr. Shen

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480
This way, please.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.160
How are we supposed to continue filming now?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.890
Mr. Shen, please have a seat. I really don't know.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.880
Regarding your production team's previous actions,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.840
I need a formal written apology

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320
delivered to my artist.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.400
Rest assured, Mr. Shen,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400
we promise this won't happen again.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.000
The urgent matter now

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.040
is to resolve

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.960
this issue that's preventing us from continuing the shoot.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.320
Look at all these people waiting,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.240
exactly.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.920
First, you need to understand her true personality.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.180
Only by finding her authentic character

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.780
can you create better content for your show.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.500
For example, here,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.600
when Zheng Ying discovers her partner Wan Yuchen

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.000
lying in the room sleeping,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.880
while Wan Yuchen lies to her

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160
claiming he's working on a task.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.440
At this moment, Zheng Ying must be extremely angry.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.370
And needs to vent her frustration.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.880
How dare you, Shen Yifan,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.320
not trying to stop me when I said I was giving up!

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.120
Why? Why? Why?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.960
After venting,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.920
what she'll want to do most

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.580
is definitely have a big meal.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.320
You're eating so much now,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.250
will you still eat dinner tonight?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.760
At night,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.040
when she's alone,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.170
she'll certainly feel regretful.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.540
She might even cry.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200
At that moment,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.250
you should stop filming

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.920
and turn off the cameras.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.840
Why did I say I was giving up?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.480
What's the point of trying to look cool?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.040
This way there's no hope at all.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.880
What on earth did I say?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.200
Mr. Shen.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.320
Young Mr. Shen is in too much pain to lie down.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.640
He can only sleep sitting up.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640
Please think of something quickly.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.930
Don't worry.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.360
This place belongs to my friend.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.560
I've already spoken to them.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.760
No one will come here.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.280
Do you need something from me?

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.000
Over these years, I've heard many things about you.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.130
I know you've been struggling abroad.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.100
Especially...

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.820
Why didn't you contact me?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.320
Why would I contact you?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.280
Our separation was my fault.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.440
But Ni Hao is still my son.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.240
Wait.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.720
Are you saying

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.040
that Ni Hao is your son?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.490
You're still keeping this from me?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480
I let you down before.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840
But at least give me a chance to make amends.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.760
Yes,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.080
I'm not doing as well as you now.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.120
You're a star,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.760
while I'm just a manager.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.680
But... enough.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.040
Ni Hao is my son.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.200
He has nothing to do with you.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.440
Xu Zhao.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.520
I have something important to tell you.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680
Can you stop bothering me?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.580
Don't secretly buy him toys anymore.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.860
Or take him out to play.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.280
Also, about tonight's film festival closing ceremony.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.040
Would you like to attend?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.720
They invited Shen Yifan to attend

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720
the opening ceremony of that film festival.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.600
And they want me for the closing ceremony?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.080
Yes.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.680
Besides the regular activities at today's closing ceremony,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.720
there's also a new award ceremony added.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.520
It includes the Most Anticipated Newcomer Award.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.800
Zheng Ying was nominated for her role as the assassin in 'Dual Beauties' Battle'

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.159
for this award.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.800
Good.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.960
We can go check it out.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.960
Go get ready.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.440
I heard from Brother Youyi that

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.640
you've been nominated for the Most Anticipated Newcomer Award.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.960
We should celebrate this properly.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.560
Is this hat too small,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.600
or is your head too big?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.000
It looks weird somehow.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.840
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.840
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.520
Dr. Mai mentioned you to me before.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.920
Yes.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.440
Alright, see you later.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.120
Bye-bye.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.559
What's wrong? This looks fine.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.720
Why aren't you wearing it?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.840
Bad luck.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.640
Why is there such a sour smell in the air?

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.880
Who spilled the vinegar jar?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.120
Time is precious. Focus on your work.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.580
And stop flirting around.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.720
From an anonymous colleague.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.400
Sit there.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.360
Why is there so much?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.290
This is your first award after all.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.060
You should take it seriously.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.440
And prepare well.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.490
I heard you were nominated too.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.400
Even if you're just a placeholder,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.160
you should at least tidy yourself up.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.640
This award is about acting skills,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.840
not about who dresses better.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.720
Hey, Mr. Liu.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.410
She's coming with full confidence to receive the award.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.080
You can't let her down.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.120
Don't worry about it.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.410
I've arranged everything.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.680
Great.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.160
Mr. Shen,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.840
your attending physician, Dr. Mai, is my senior colleague.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.240
He asked me to find you.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.760
Please return to Switzerland as soon as possible.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.160
I know.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.200
He's reminded me several times already.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.360
But you haven't gone back.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.800
Dr. Mai says there might be a heart donor available soon.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.260
You need to go back and prepare immediately.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.360
This is

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.620
my first time attending such a big event.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.120
What's wrong? Nervous?

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.560
It's just an award.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.320
You'll have plenty more chances to win awards in the future.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.920
Relax, superstar.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.620
Have you memorized your acceptance speech?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:46.920
Here.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.320
So beautiful!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.520
Zheng Ying.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.400
Mr. Cheng,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.120
aren't we being a bit too showy?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400
I think it's perfect.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.240
She won an award, so she should get

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.080
the attention and interviews from reporters, right?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.160
Oh, and make sure you remember.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.440
Don't worry, Mr. Cheng.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.100
As soon as her award news breaks, it'll immediately trend online.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.080
Mr. Shen,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.200
your ejection fraction

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.200
has decreased to 35%.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.760
You can't delay any longer.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.360
I know.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.680
Mr. Shen.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.800
Zheng Ying didn't win the award.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.520
This Best Newcomer Award

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.800
is yours this time.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.320
Here, Mr. Liu.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.040
Come.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.160
Rest assured.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.760
The help you've given me this time,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.890
my uncle will definitely remember it.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.920
I'm sorry.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.610
I have an urgent matter.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.840
It must be her doing.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.520
I can't believe she won the award.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.360
Should we still interview her?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.560
Her winning this award is hardly convincing, right?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.240
Yes.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.810
We absolutely must.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.240
We agreed to interview the winner.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.040
You all know the real situation.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.170
Do you really want to see someone like her win?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.160
Miss Chen, regarding your previous work,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.920
is it true that 'Good Pomelo' received a rating of 2.1?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.400
Miss Chen,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.320
do you think you deserve this award?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320
Everyone says this award is rigged.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.520
What do you think about that, Miss Chen?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.560
I'm not comfortable answering this question.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.400
Please ask my agent.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.320
Why are you here?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.720
I came to stand up for you.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.020
I think you truly deserve this award.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.900
Are you really okay with this?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.520
Committee Chairman.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.690
That's how we judge the awards.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.200
You're here about Zheng Ying, aren't you?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.520
Our award selection is completely fair.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.520
Fair?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.040
A new actor's hard work for so long

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.080
was easily dismissed by you.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.220
And you talk to me about fairness?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.480
What if

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.500
your deal with Chen Qing becomes public?

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.930
Would everyone still think it's fair?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.720
We're all in the same industry.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.600
No need to be so ruthless.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.520
She's just a minor actress.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.520
Mr. Shen deserves better.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.280
Do you know

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.980
how hard these young actors work?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.280
I will report this

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.730
to the committee under my name.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.170
I believe the committee

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.360
will make a truly fair judgment.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.560
And remember this:

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.920
As long as I'm around, don't even think about hurting her.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.120
Otherwise,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.160
I'll make you understand what regret truly means.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720
Otherwise,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.240
I'll make you die

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.080
a very ugly death.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440
To be honest,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.850
I'm not willing to accept this.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.440
But someone once told me

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.560
that no effort is ever wasted.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.440
All the hardships you've endured

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.840
are the stepping stones beneath your feet.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.080
One day they will lift you up high.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.530
Those who looked down on you before

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.040
will have to crane their necks to look at you.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.440
I will work even harder in the days to come.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.760
I believe

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
what's meant to be mine will be mine,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360
sooner or later.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.490
You spoke well just now.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.840
Thank you.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.500
I don't accept verbal thanks.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.760
I've booked a really nice restaurant.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.000
Have dinner with me.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.250
It's your chance to thank me properly.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.600
I need to go back to the set for recording.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.560
So dinner is off.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.440
Alright.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.760
What would you like to eat? My treat.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.520
Great.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.340
I won't hold back then.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.760
Shen Yifan.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.600
What's wrong?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.960
Don't be afraid. I'll take you to the hospital right away.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.600
Doctor!

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.800
Help!

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.080
Doctor!

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.400
Doctor! Help!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.480
Doctor!

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.420
Family members please wait outside.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.720
So

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.720
everything you said was true.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.440
Is your heart condition really so serious

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.240
that you could die from any emotional excitement?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.720
Why is this happening?

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.840
No.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.800
I won't let you die.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.300
And I won't let you push me away again.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.880
You're finally awake.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.140
You scared me to death.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.040
It's not like you haven't seen this before.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.840
What's there to be so scared about?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.700
What nonsense.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840
No matter how many times this happens,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.500
it's still terrifying, okay?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.970
You have no idea.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.960
If you really didn't wake up,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.200
then I would...

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.140
Then...

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.240
you could inherit the Shen family fortune, right?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.440
I'd give you all the Shen family assets.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.840
You earned it all anyway.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.570
You better stay alive, you hear me?

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.480
I'm serious.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.560
I'm warning you,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.760
don't pull any of that

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.480
self-righteous 'graceful exit' nonsense.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.760
You're my only family in this world.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.800
Do you understand?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.080
I know, I know.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.250
Please go out first.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.480
Go on.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.120
Alright.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.240
Get some good rest.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.960
My brother's collapse this time,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.220
I heard it was because of that Zheng Ying.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.920
Where is she?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.840
After she brought Mr. Shen back,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.200
she disappeared.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.920
What's wrong?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.240
Are you asking for someone else again today?

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.680
No.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.880
This time I want to seriously consult

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.080
about heart disease.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.080
I can certainly give you a serious consultation.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.840
But could you take a photo with me first?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.640
My daughter is a big fan of yours.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.280
Come on.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.000
One, two, three.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.560
About heart disease,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.640
it's like this.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.840
There are congenital and acquired types.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840
Everyone's symptoms

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.700
are different.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.960
It varies from person to person.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.280
She's trending again. She's really popular lately.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:46.960
Yeah.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.800
These days,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.960
artists who dare to openly express their ambitions

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.200
are quite rare.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.320
I also heard

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.680
that this press interview

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.920
was apparently arranged by Cheng Moyang from Yiping Sunshine,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.980
Mr. Cheng himself.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.640
Look, someone took this photo at the event.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.440
Let me see.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.360
They really look good together.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.010
I'm shipping them already.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.160
Right?

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.120
They really are a perfect match.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.250
So lovely together.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.520
It seems that everyone knows

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.000
we're a perfect match,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.840
right?

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.960
I'm here to tell you some good news.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.600
I've arranged a medical consultation with specialists for you.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.600
Why would you do that?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.140
You're Zheng Ying's boss,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.840
so it's appropriate for me to take care of you

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.720
for her sake.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360
I don't need that.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.520
Sit down.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.120
You don't need to feel burdened.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400
Just accept it.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.960
But I have one condition.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.680
Since you don't like her

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.440
and have rejected her,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.320
keep your distance from her.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.640
Understand?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.400
Zheng Ying.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.890
I've never had romantic feelings for you.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.640
I have never,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.440
ever liked you that way.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.680
Why are you here?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.440
My boss is sick.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.400
As an employee,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.160
it's only right for me to take care

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.290
of my boss, isn't it?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.960
Lie down.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.000
Eat.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.160
You should be filming your variety show right now,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840
not here peeling apples for me.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.960
Don't get angry.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.730
It's bad for your heart.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.840
Zheng Ying.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.240
Didn't you promise me

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.050
that from now on,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.290
we would just be boss and employee?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.450
Didn't you promise not to cross the line anymore?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.220
I know everything now.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.200
I know you're sick.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.040
So what?

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760
Before long,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.880
I'll be a dead man.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.900
You're scared.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960
This is who I am.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.010
Do you still like me?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.330
Do you dare to still like me?

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.720
I like you.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.160
I dare to like you.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.620
What about you?

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.840
Look me in the eyes.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.880
Just answer me.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.280
Do you like me?

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.000
Do you want to be with me?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
You can leave now.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.840
Shen Yifan.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.600
Are you sure you want me to leave?

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.960
Shen Yifan.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.200
Shen Yifan.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.200
I'm asking you one last time.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.520
Can you bear to let me go?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.560
If you're still going to lie to me,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.360
lie to yourself that you can bear it,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.880
then I'll leave right now.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.520
Can you bear to see me dating other men?

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.800
Can you bear to see me with another man,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.400
holding hands and embracing in front of you,

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.130
calling each other 'darling'?

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.120
I'll be with another man,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.840
eating your favorite snacks,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.160
watching your favorite movies.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.960
Going to

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.640
your favorite places in the world,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.300
seeing the scenery you've always wanted to see.
