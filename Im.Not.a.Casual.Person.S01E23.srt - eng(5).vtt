WEBVTT

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.360
Hello?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.840
What's wrong?

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.360
Why are you calling me now?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.520
I miss you.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.200
Come on, look over here.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.040
I miss you too.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.200
Okay.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Let's change to the next set of poses.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.259
The next set, okay?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.600
Good.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.250
What are you smiling at?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.040
When you left

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.400
you asked if I had any regrets.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.640
I said no,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.880
but I lied to you, Shen Yifan.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.760
Actually,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.810
I do have one regret.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.120
Fighting over a ring.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.880
Attending our child's parent-teacher conference.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.810
Our child's graduation ceremony.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.720
Isn't something still missing?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.680
Our happy life together.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Where should it begin?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720
So,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.600
you'd better come back soon to make up for this regret.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.880
Otherwise,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.850
I won't let you off the hook.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.240
Shen Yifan.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.160
I miss you.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.360
Shen Yifan.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.440
I miss you.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.320
Shen Yifan.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.200
Shen Yifan.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.480
Excuse me.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.840
Could you please... Sorry.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.440
Could you please come back safely to see me soon?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.880
I really, really miss you so much.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440
Shen Yifan.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.520
I miss you so much.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.600
Shen Yifan.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600
[Renovating Wenmu Tomb]

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.400
Lawyer Liu.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.320
Mr. Shen.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.480
Actually, you could wait a bit longer for Xinyuan.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.440
There's no need to rush with the will.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.770
There's no time to wait.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.600
I don't have much time left.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.399
Let's begin.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.160
Regarding the will,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.300
let me confirm with you once more.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.040
All assets under your name,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.700
half will go to Ms. Zheng Ying,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.560
and half to Mr. Shen Yiyang.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.650
Is that correct?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.440
One house and one car

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.000
will be left to Mr. Wu Yu.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.720
Is that so?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.200
Yes.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.320
Additionally, after your death,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.580
regarding the funeral arrangements...

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.880
Lawyer Liu.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.880
Thank you.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.120
Without my signature,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.480
who gave you permission to refuse treatment?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.010
I knew you wouldn't sign it.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.260
Good that you know.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.650
So I asked the hospital.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.140
The doctor said

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.650
patients can sign for themselves.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.960
Why?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.440
Why would you do this?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200
All your life,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.640
you've been a coward.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.880
You've never signed anything.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.410
Mom and Dad's car accident,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760
you didn't sign the death certificate.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.640
Moving house,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.440
going abroad,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.400
you didn't sign for those either.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.530
Starting a company,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.810
signing contracts,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.770
you never signed those either.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.600
So this time,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.610
I don't plan to let you sign either.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.159
Don't think that by

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.720
playing the emotional card with me

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.120
I'll let you off the hook.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.120
You...

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.280
If you leave like this,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.720
I will never forgive you.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.440
I'm someone who doesn't like to leave any regrets.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.240
But this time,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.220
it seems I'm going to fail.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.090
The number you have dialed is powered off.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.640
Pick up the phone.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.800
Please pick up.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.570
Who else can I contact to reach him?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.880
Doctor.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.920
Yes,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.700
find the doctor's number.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.760
Ying.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.240
What's wrong?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.500
The set is ready. Let's go over there.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.440
Okay.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.560
Okay. Right away.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.800
This angle works well.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.880
What's wrong with her?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.210
She doesn't seem right.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.880
This scene

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.880
is about her witnessing her beloved man

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.940
Mingjing's death.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.320
Having these emotions

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.520
is perfectly normal.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.440
Mingjing.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.000
Who are you?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.440
I am his brother,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.440
Mingshu.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.320
What did you do to him?

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.600
I didn't do much,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.600
just before impersonating him,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.100
I pretended to be you to lure and kill him.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.640
He thought you were injured

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.140
and followed you here,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.520
falling into my trap.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.880
You've already been poisoned by my soul-breaking powder.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.880
Today is the day you both die.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.800
Shanlan.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.680
I finally understand how precious time is.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.240
Now I

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.560
just want to

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.620
spend the rest of my life with you.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.640
Mingjing,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.800
don't leave me.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.480
Mingjing,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.640
don't leave me.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.040
Don't leave me.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.400
I still want to

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.620
spend the rest of my life with you.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.400
Stop.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.640
Ying.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120
It's okay. Get up.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.400
Ying.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.650
What's wrong, Ying?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.400
Someone come!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.160
Help!

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.920
Ms. Zheng.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.600
What happened?

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.280
Ms. Zheng?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800
This time,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.080
why did it take you so long to come back?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.120
I see you're doing

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.520
quite well here.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.680
What about Cheng Moyang?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200
He's waited for you his entire life.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.280
You should give him a chance.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.320
Just give him a chance.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.440
You're not coming back,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.160
are you?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.680
No, I'm not.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.660
Take care of yourself.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.920
You

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.840
are so selfish.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.960
When you were alive,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.560
you left me once.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.840
And now you're dead,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.480
you're leaving me again.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.680
Why don't you answer me?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.680
What's wrong with you?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.120
Shen Yifan,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.340
you told me not to wait for you.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.120
That's what you said.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.820
Brother Youyi.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.320
It's been a whole day.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.200
Why is there no movement at all?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.080
How about

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320
we open it?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.370
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.440
We can't wait anymore.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.040
If we wait any longer, they'll get suspicious.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.400
Brother Youyi.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.060
What's my schedule for today?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.200
Um,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.840
here's today's schedule

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.610
and the preface written by the screenwriter.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.010
Aren't you going to the set?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.280
Yes,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.570
I'm going right now.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.040
Youyi,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.080
why is Zheng Ying suddenly acting like this?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.500
There's no reason.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.220
She's truly my artist,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.040
so strong.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.480
What about Shen Yifan?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.080
From now on,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.080
don't mention Shen Yifan's name again,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.960
or else I'll...

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.400
But what if...

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.560
Not even once.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.960
I'm sorry.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.970
It's okay. Let's try again.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.300
Come on, one more time.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.930
Senior, I've been away from the Three Halls for several months now.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.920
Do you want to slow down?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.080
Who are you looking down on?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080
Don't waste time.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.840
Speed it up.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.460
All of you come at once.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800
I'm in a hurry.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.240
Cut!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.400
Not bad.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.130
Prepare for the next scene.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.800
It feels like Zheng Ying has become a completely different person.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.800
Lately,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.359
the phrase she says most often is

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.200
'don't waste time.'

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.700
Doesn't that sound familiar?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.490
Isn't that what Shen...

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.200
what that person used to say?

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.740
She's deliberately turned herself into his image.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.120
This director today

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.720
is so incompetent.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.680
Didn't even review the commercial script before coming.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.010
Has no idea how to shoot.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.160
Alright.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.000
'Drunken Jade Mountain' is about to wrap up.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.600
After shooting tomorrow's commercial,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.200
why don't we

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.800
have the company arrange a few days off for you?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.360
These are scripts selected by the company.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.220
The fastest one

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.040
will start production within a week.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.700
Satisfied?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.440
Now that's

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.480
the attitude of a manager

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.410
who wants to exploit their artist.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.440
Are you

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.360
really planning to use heavy workloads

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.440
to numb yourself?

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.610
Why would I need to numb myself?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440
If you miss him, actually...

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.680
Why would I miss him?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.160
I'm very happy now.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.680
I didn't even say who 'he' is,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.960
yet you're already defending yourself,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.560
claiming you don't miss him.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.680
What I mean is,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.840
right now I only want to

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.440
work,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.120
act,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.780
win awards.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.570
I don't want anything else.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.840
What's wrong?

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.840
How was it?

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.300
Did I do well in that scene?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.120
Let's go home.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.020
Is it a power outage or did the circuit breaker trip?

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880
Where's my phone?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.680
Are we out of medicine at home?

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.920
This injury-prone artist at home

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.580
needs to take better care of herself.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.420
You think just leaving a medicine box is enough?

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.040
If that director keeps acting like this,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.200
I'm really going to get angry.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.560
Don't say I'm being a diva then.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.620
Hello, Miss Zheng.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.720
My name is Liu Zhang.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.520
Starting today,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.720
I'll be the director of our commercial.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.360
Director Liu,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:09.880
hello.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.340
Thanks for your hard work.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.650
What's going on?

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.520
I was just complaining about the director yesterday

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.180
and today he's been replaced.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.480
Did you make a wish

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.440
with Aladdin's lamp last night?

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.120
The thing is,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.440
he even called me over

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.320
like he was a genie

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.180
asking what wish I wanted.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.770
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.720
Hello, Mrs. Zhao.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.880
Zheng,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.320
your lease is about to expire.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.200
Yes, I'm planning to renew it.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.600
I'm getting married again soon.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.040
So I'm planning to move back here

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.960
You'll need to find a new place to live.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.360
No.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.800
You've been married five times before

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.800
and never said you wanted to move back in.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.320
Besides, I just fixed the electric meter yesterday.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.720
You people in your line of work make money so easily.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.240
Buying a house should be a piece of cake for you, right?

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240
Move out quickly.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.320
That's true.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.560
I can buy my own house.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.860
[80.00ml|Nanguo Garden 2BR 1BA]

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.840
When will I ever

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.960
have my own place?

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.040
Someday

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.120
I'll live there.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.090
At your current acting fee,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.120
if you work hard for 10 years without eating or drinking,

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.720
you might be able to afford

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360
a bathroom there.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.240
Don't underestimate me.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.080
Although I haven't started filming 'Twin Beauties' yet,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.240
someday

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.240
I will become

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.520
a popular actress.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.060
A top-tier performer.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.520
By then,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.840
I'll buy this apartment outright.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040
I've got it all planned out.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.320
I want floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.240
And

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.800
I want a large open kitchen.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.280
Also,

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.280
a study just for novels.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.480
From my bedroom,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.000
there'll be a beautiful view.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.800
Hey, Youyi.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.480
I need to rent a new apartment.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.420
No problem.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
Moving tomorrow.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.840
Brother.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.080
You bought this place?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.640
As your manager,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.040
buying you an apartment is a simple matter.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.450
Go see if you like it.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.800
So, do you like it?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.500
Did you decorate this too?

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.040
Of course.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.400
As your manager,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.600
aren't I thoughtful?

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.340
What about this photo?

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.080
Only he and I knew about this photo.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.640
Where did you get it?

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600
This kind of thing

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.800
is easy to find out with a few questions.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.480
Youyi.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.560
He arranged all this, didn't he?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.360
Who? I arranged everything myself.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.640
When did you meet him?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.280
What else did he arrange?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360
How is he doing now?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
Where is he now?

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.320
Youyi.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.600
What do you know? Please tell me.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.240
As soon as she says she wants to change apartments,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.570
do exactly as I told you.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.280
What else did he say?

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.560
He also said

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.000
that you should treat this as your home

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.600
and wait for him to come back.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.020
So he thinks he can just buy me off with an apartment?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.680
Dream on.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640
Actually, this apartment isn't good at all.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.560
It's too big.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.810
It must be exhausting to clean.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.490
Didn't he arrange for a cleaning lady?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.960
And look at this sofa,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.480
the coffee table, the wallpaper -

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.740
they're all too plain.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.760
And this lamp,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.690
why is it so ugly?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.500
