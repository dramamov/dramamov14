00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.540
Director Chang

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.640
Understood.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.840
I got it.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.560
Okay.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.760
I'll go check out the situation first.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.800
If necessary,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.320
I'll request backup from the team.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.120
Alright.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.360
What's wrong?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.280
Nothing.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.920
Chi Xia

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.600
I'm leaving.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
Where are you going?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.920
To Tu Guolin's hometown,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.640
Yuji.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800
Aren't you afraid of breaking the rules?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.060
What are you thinking?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.600
There's an abandoned resort in Yuji

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.280
where a homicide occurred.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.520
Three people died.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.240
The town police station requested support from the city bureau.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120
Chief Chang wants us to go there first.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Let's go.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.240
Wait.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.360
Let me be clear upfront.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.280
Follow all orders.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.690
About Tu Guolin,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.080
we'll discuss it when the time is right.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.840
Jue.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.039
After I leave,

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.280
the team is in your hands.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.610
If you need anything...

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.200
Be careful.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.960
Bye.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.640
Chi Xia

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.440
Qu Bai

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.120
What are you doing here?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.160
I'm here for business.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.120
Come in quickly.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.610
Don't stay out here.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.120
Here, dry yourself.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.920
Thank you.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.840
Not bad, Mr. Qu.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.480
Your business has reached into the rural economy.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.680
Just making a living.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.960
I have a construction team

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.440
working with Yuji Village Committee on road construction.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.570
So I come here often.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280
I heard that Yuji is developing rural tourism this time,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.200
so I came to see

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.400
if there's anything I can help with.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.520
Just call it making money.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.980
Why make it sound so noble?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.260
No need.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.050
Officer Luo,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.320
we meet again.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.280
Yes,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.160
we meet again.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.000
Why do we keep running into each other?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Maybe I have a special connection with the police.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.680
Having a connection with the police

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.210
isn't exactly a good thing.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.400
I think it's quite nice.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.460
Makes me feel safe.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.600
Why don't we talk inside?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.410
You might catch a cold out here.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.640
Officers, please carry on with your work.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280
I need to go out for something.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.440
I'm also staying at the government guesthouse.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.040
We'll catch up another time.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.280
Here, this is yours.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.079
Thank you.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.880
Coming.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.520
Coming.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.600
Is it really as you feared?

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.520
Perhaps.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.440
Young master,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.240
what should we do next?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.920
Stay alert

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.760
and adapt to the situation.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.490
Understood.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.680
Which room is that person staying in?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.600
Which person?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.440
The one who talked to us at the entrance.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.160
Tall guy.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.300
Fair-skinned.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.839
Looks quite refined.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.019
Surname Qu.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.079
Can you check for me?

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.839
Sorry,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.170
we can't disclose customer information.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.730
We're police officers.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.640
Room 316.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.570
How many people?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.320
One,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.360
but there's another person traveling with him,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360
staying across from him in Room 317.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.680
When did they arrive?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.800
Half an hour ago.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
Captain Luo, what are you doing?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.720
I have reasonable suspicion.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.520
I'm working.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.920
Your rooms are ready,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.200
225 and 226.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.920
Let's pack up

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.080
and go straight to the station.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.810
Captain Luo.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.560
Hello, Captain Luo.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200
I'm a police officer from Yuji Town station.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.040
My name is Wei Guoliang.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.280
You can call me Xiao Wei.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.400
Our chief is away for training.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.120
He asked me to escort you both to the station

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.240
and assist with your investigation.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.800
Hello.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.800
This is Chi Xia from the Major Crimes Unit.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.360
Hello, boss.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.600
I'm not your boss.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.720
We're all comrades.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.520
Then let's

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.160
go straight to the station.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.960
Okay.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.040
I apologize,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.840
officers.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.880
It's on the display board.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.210
Let's make do with this.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280
Here's the situation.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.240
Yesterday afternoon,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.760
the station received an anonymous call.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.640
The caller

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.480
reported finding multiple bodies at Bailong Resort,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.800
then hung up immediately.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.480
I didn't have time to verify the caller's identity

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.400
and led a team directly to the scene.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.280
When we arrived,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.200
all the abandoned buildings had their doors and windows sealed.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.720
We noticed one door was open

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.250
and went in to investigate.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.880
I should add something here.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.120
In these abandoned buildings at Bailong Resort,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960
there were multiple wooden statues stored,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.760
including mountain deity statues,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.880
twelve in total.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.000
These mountain deity statues have protected Yuji Town residents for generations

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.480
and hold a very important place

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.960
in the hearts of the townspeople.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.890
So to prevent the wooden statues from being damaged,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.800
the village chief had all doors and windows sealed.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.360
After we entered the scene,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.520
we found nothing unusual.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.520
So I went to the adjacent storage room.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.480
The door to this storage room wouldn't open at first,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.720
so I looked through a small window on the side.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.600
And when I looked,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.660
I immediately spotted three bodies.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.240
A locked room murder.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.560
There's one more detail I should add.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.800
The village chief said that in this abandoned building,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.680
there used to be only ten statues,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.560
but somehow the number increased to twelve.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.090
So we can't rule out that the killer deliberately moved them in.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.320
The number twelve that didn't appear in the last case

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.400
has shown up here.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.720
It's the fox's doing.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.200
What fox?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.360
Never mind.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.360
Please continue.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.520
Judging from the clothing of the three victims,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.480
they appear to be hikers who came here for recreation.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.920
We don't know exactly why

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.200
they entered the Bailong Resort.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.400
That's still unclear.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.760
The cause of death is also unknown.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.480
I've already notified the county forensic team.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.080
They're coming here from another scene.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.520
But I just received their call.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.200
Due to the heavy rain,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.680
the only access road is flooded.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.280
So they definitely won't make it here tonight.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.440
Do this:

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.840
send me all the photos

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.200
of the bodies later.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.320
I'll forward them to the city forensic team

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.780
and ask them to take a look.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240
This resort,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.320
after it was abandoned,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.980
has no one taken it over since?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.680
This hillside has actually been abandoned for a long time.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.840
Recently, a businessman

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.000
leased this entire area

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.040
to develop it for tourism.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.800
That's why people are paying attention to it again.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.600
By the way.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.520
Sir,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.400
the developer asked me to request from you both

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000
that news about this case

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.560
absolutely must not leak out.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.960
He's afraid it will affect the tourism development,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.490
which would also impact Yuji Town's poverty alleviation plan.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.520
That businessman,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.920
when he heard that before construction even began,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.720
three people had already died,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.880
was scared to death.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.760
Now he's hiding in that rundown Jixiang Inn across the street

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.560
and doesn't dare to leave at all.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.920
What kind of businessman is this?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.360
What poor mental fortitude.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.280
An entrepreneur from Dongzhou,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.040
Tu Guolin.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.360
Who?

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.600
Tu Guolin.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.760
Where is he now?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.720
Mr. Tu,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.480
why aren't you handling your brother's funeral

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.880
but came to Yuji instead?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.240
My brother's funeral,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.900
I sent my ex-wife to handle it.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.360
Wait a minute.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.600
Didn't you say before

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.600
that whether Tu Guo'an lived or died

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.130
didn't matter to you at all?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.320
I did say that,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.720
but he's still my only family.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.520
Show respect for the dead.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.760
I still need to see him off on his final journey.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.400
It's just that I've run into some trouble lately.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.280
I couldn't get away,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.640
so I asked my ex-wife to go instead.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.840
What kind of trouble?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.520
Business troubles.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.560
Business troubles?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.640
Is it serious enough to hide in this small hotel?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.100
Isn't this your hometown?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.200
I had no choice.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.880
My funding chain broke.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.919
I don't dare go back to my old house.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.940
What if creditors come knocking?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.360
Most importantly,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.400
as soon as I arrived in Yuji,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.039
my project manager Wang Sheng told me

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.890
that at Bailong Resort,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.120
someone died,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.520
and the deceased was holding my business card when they died.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.080
All these problems are coming at me at once.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.680
You think I want to stay here?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.280
Isn't that the police station across the street?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.720
I thought I could get police protection.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.800
And you two,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.240
instead of catching the killer,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.050
you're here interrogating me.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.010
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640
This is our standard police procedure.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.960
Just cooperate and we'll be done.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.680
Cooperate.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.320
I'll fully cooperate.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.720
The police haven't released any case details to the public.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.120
How did Wang Sheng know

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.120
about the murder at Bailong Resort?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.080
Wang Sheng is the project manager of Bailong Resort.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.360
It's our property.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.280
Get him here.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.000
I can't reach him.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.880
I called him two hours ago,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.100
but his phone has been off since then.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.080
Do you think he's telling the truth?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.880
No.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.520
At least his claim about coming to Yuji to avoid debts is definitely false.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.560
He didn't even bring luggage.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.040
He wasn't planning to stay long.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.700
Be careful.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.800
Heizi,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.200
are you in Yuji?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.320
Great!

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.850
I need you to watch someone.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.800
Jixiang Inn.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.560
Tu Guolin.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.520
Well,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.880
Captain Luo,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.580
you can find helpers even in such a remote place.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.320
He's helped the police solve cases before.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.120
Both have helped solve police cases,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.050
yet the treatment is worlds apart.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.090
Don't use that sarcastic tone with me.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.650
I know what you're going to say.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.850
How can Heizi be compared to Qu Bai?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.120
With Heizi,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.720
I know everything about him.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.240
He was imprisoned for theft before,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.880
did time in jail,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.800
served his sentence,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.480
but that was to raise medical funds

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.720
for his brother who had leukemia.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.600
He's a man of loyalty and compassion.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.560
After he got out,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.160
I found him a job.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.000
He works diligently

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.800
and hasn't broken the law since.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.880
When I need help,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.680
I ask for his assistance,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.780
and he helps me unconditionally.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.640
Do you think

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.520
Qu Bai could do all this?

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.580
How would you know?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.880
Fine.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.200
Captain Luo,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.080
I understand everything you've said,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.320
but regarding your last question,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.000
I have my reservations.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.960
Young Master.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.360
Tu Guolin's company executive

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.160
Wang Sheng, who's in charge of Yuji Tourism Development, has gone missing.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160
Can you find him?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.730
I'll figure something out.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.570
As soon as possible.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.520
Once you find him, leak the information.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.440
Make it clean.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.170
Don't worry.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.970
Captain Luo.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.720
Heizi.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.800
Any updates?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.680
Someone is watching Tu Guolin.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.080
Based on their behavior,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.520
it seems like two separate groups.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.720
Keep observing them.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.040
Find out what each group is after.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.080
Got it.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.440
Mr. Ning,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.680
do you have any conclusions?

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.680
What kind of conclusion do you want?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.640
You've been giving me nothing but difficult problems all day.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.040
Who told you

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.840
that forensic experts can perform autopsies from photos?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.200
Only you could come up with something like this.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.040
Thanks for your hard work.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.900
I'll bring you some Yuji specialties when I return.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.600
Just from looking at the photos,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.200
the three victims appear to have

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.160
died from suffocation

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.080
in a state of hypothermia and oxygen deprivation.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.320
But under any circumstances,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.800
considering the current season

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.260
and the environment shown in the photos,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.520
it just feels...

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.520
Very strange.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.000
Completely unreasonable.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Have you been to the crime scene yet?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.200
Not yet.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200
It's dark and the roads are slippery.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.480
We're planning to go first thing in the morning.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.480
Director Chang asked me to come support you tomorrow.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.400
Be careful out there.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.660
See you tomorrow then.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.320
That's great.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320
See you tomorrow.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.280
Captain Luo,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.320
are you resting?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.200
What is it?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.880
Just helping the boss solve some problems.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.800
I am getting a bit hungry.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.200
Come on in.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.780
Make yourself at home.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.840
Sit there.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.160
Not bad.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.280
What skill does instant noodles require?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.010
It tastes better than Curly's.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.560
This case is exhausting.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.520
I'm starving.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.420
Any new developments?

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.080
Tu Guolin wasn't lying.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.560
He was indeed being watched.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.960
By two different groups.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.440
I never expected that in this small town of Yuji,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.970
because of one murder case,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.730
two rival forces would emerge.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.800
Interesting.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.690
I'm afraid there are more than two groups.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960
The number twelve has appeared again.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.760
It's possible

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.600
we were also lured here.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.840
But twelve didn't appear

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.620
in the skeleton dumping case.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.860
But come to think of it,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.800
it really doesn't seem like a coincidence.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.400
I feel like

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.280
the secrets I carry

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.280
will soon be revealed.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.930
Don't worry.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.200
Don't be afraid of their provocations.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.640
I'll face them with you.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.920
Captain Luo

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.050
We found something.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.440
These three people

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.640
all come from other provinces,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.240
namely Yao Lixing,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.540
Shi Guangxuan,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.720
Guo Yiliang.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.080
The three of them belong to the same

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.600
outdoor sports club.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.880
They get along very well

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.160
and often travel together for adventure.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.600
According to their families' recollections.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.000
This isn't their first time coming to Yuji.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.600
They came once before, five years ago.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.400
But the specific details from five years ago,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.800
the families don't know.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.600
The city forensic examiner Ning Yi has arrived

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.800
and is performing the autopsy.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.680
Notify our off-duty colleagues

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.960
to investigate the three victims

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.090
and their visit to Yuji five years ago.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.120
You,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160
take me and Chi Xia

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.580
to the crime scene.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.320
Captain Luo,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.160
this is the place.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160
This place

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.490
really doesn't seem to get many visitors.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.960
This way.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.360
Captain Luo, be careful.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.360
This storage room door

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.820
was extremely difficult to open at the time.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.840
Back then, we

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.560
discovered the three bodies through this window.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.800
When we were outside,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.440
we couldn't determine if the three were alive or dead,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.240
so we immediately broke down the door.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.040
After entering, we found all three people were already dead,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.000
so we immediately went back outside

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.240
and notified the police.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.920
The three victims were found in different positions.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.960
One of them

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.160
was in this position,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.680
died with his eyes wide open

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.120
and his body completely rigid.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.120
The second person was by the toilet,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.360
somewhat curled up,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.960
as if frightened by something.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.480
The last person

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.240
was the one bracing against the door.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.840
Here.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.360
Yes.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.080
At that time, he was

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.880
acting like he was afraid something would come in.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.600
Wei.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400
Did the village chief mention

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.520
which two sculptures were brought in later?

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.560
The chief didn't say,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.480
because he mentioned

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.210
he couldn't remember clearly.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.840
Don't you smell something strange?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.560
No.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.050
Something's wrong.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.099
This isn't an ordinary smell.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.400
It's the smell of rotting flesh.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
Maybe it's because this room gets no sunlight

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.200
and all the doors and windows are sealed.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.160
It's been closed up

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.890
for too long.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.840
Could the deaths of these three men

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.600
possibly be caused by accidental factors?

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.200
In such a remote mountain environment,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.480
it would take enormous effort

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.160
to create a cold,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.800
frightening,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.600
oxygen-deprived environment.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.120
It's as if someone was

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.120
performing some kind of ritual.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.490
