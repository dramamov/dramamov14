WEBVTT

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.000
Mr. Tu.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.460
Captain Luo, Officer Chi.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.560
He's willing to talk now.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.040
I'll tell you everything.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.840
Go ahead.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.880
Actually,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.320
I'm not Tu Guolin.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.880
I'm Tu Guo'an.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.960
And then?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.200
Then,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320
what happened to your foster parents wasn't my doing.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.480
It was my brother.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.280
Back then,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.800
I was down on my luck.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.440
To make a living,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.120
I worked as a thug for Fox.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
But one day she came to me

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.320
asking me to kill someone

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.160
and make it look like an accident.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.079
I was fine being her muscle,

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:30.760
scaring people a bit.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.890
That was no problem.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.720
But murder? I wouldn't dare.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.760
So I got scared

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.040
and went into hiding.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.360
You're saying

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.380
Tu Guolin killed them instead of you?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.540
A big businessman,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.920
a well-known entrepreneur in Dongzhou,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.240
was willing to kill for you?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.360
From what I know,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.440
after your parents divorced,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.970
weren't you two estranged?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.200
Not being close

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.920
doesn't mean no contact at all.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
Just a few days after I went into hiding,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.000
he found me.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.260
He said he killed someone in a fit of rage.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.040
It was

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.900
that family massacre on Pingjiang Road.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.680
My brother

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.800
has had violent tendencies since childhood.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.280
After our parents divorced, no one controlled him,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.600
no one could keep his temper in check.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.520
Later he would beat and verbally abuse his employees.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.320
And also,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.040
we both really love cats.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.440
But his love for cats

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.160
was almost pathological.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.360
That day, he happened to see the Zhou family killing a cat,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.620
and in a moment of rage,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.040
he killed the entire family.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.320
So from that point on, you two switched identities?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.120
Yes.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.400
Then he asked me

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.200
to help take care of his wife and child.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.120
To protect them from being implicated,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.320
he even got divorced.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.400
Later, following Fox's instructions,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400
he went after your foster parents.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.720
Then he used

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.480
the method of leaving a kettle boiling dry

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.079
to cause an accidental fire.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.400
This kind of thing

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.800
is untraceable.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.690
That's why the police officers handling the case didn't detect it.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.440
I recorded it at the time.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.460
I have a recording.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.380
Why are you coming so late?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840
I have a job for you.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.400
608 Pingjiang Road.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.120
Find an opportunity to get close to that place.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.250
Should I get some guys to rough them up?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.399
There's a couple living there.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.200
I want you to find a way to create an accident.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.090
You understand what I mean?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.880
An accident?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.840
You want to get rid of them?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.170
The meaning of accident

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.160
is accidental death.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.400
Alright.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.600
Wait for my news.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.360
Okay.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.080
Later, I became suspicious.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.600
I had someone

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.880
check on that Liu guy who contacted Wang Sheng.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
What did you find?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.800
Found out he's not even surnamed Liu.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
His surname is Mo.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.280
His name is Mo Laoqi.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.760
He seems to be

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.560
a senior executive at Shengtian Group.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.960
He has a special relationship with the Fox.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.120
Otherwise,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.780
how could the Fox possibly know my whereabouts?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.100
I even have his photo here.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.640
Hurry up.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.880
Don't worry, can't find it?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.920
It's here.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.340
We've met this person before.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.220
What else do you need to confess to me?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.940
Tu Guolin is awake.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.340
Chi Xia and Luo Xun went to see him.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.360
I don't know if the information revealed

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.000
will be disadvantageous to Chi Xiao.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.460
Do we need to do something?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.400
Actually, that person is called Tu Guo'an.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.760
Back then,

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.220
his brother Tu Guolin was the killer.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.240
He's a witness.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.280
Once they have evidence,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040
will the Fox...

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.240
You know which side you're on now.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.320
That's good.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.040
Don't worry.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.840
I can't have a criminal record in this country.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.840
So someone has to

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.520
take the blame.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.320
I understand.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.160
According to the evidence provided by Tu Guo'an,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.020
it can be confirmed

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.880
that Chi Xiao is the mastermind

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360
behind the murder of the Lin couple.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.640
Meanwhile,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.800
she is also connected to several previous murder cases.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.880
Her actions are extremely vicious,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.560
and she must be apprehended as soon as possible.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.920
Yes.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.520
Although currently

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.680
we haven't located Chi Xiao's whereabouts,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.000
we have found a new lead.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.330
Everyone, look.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.720
According to Tu Guo'an,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.120
it was because of this Mo Laoqi's appearance

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.360
that Chi Xiao realized her true identity.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.440
He suspects that Mo Laoqi

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.880
has a complicated relationship with Chi Xiao.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.240
We have reasonable suspicion

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240
that this Mo Laoqi

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.440
is very likely a member of the Old K criminal organization.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.170
And judging from his physique,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.280
Mo Laoqi shows signs of middle-age weight gain.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.480
He's probably the one

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.560
who kidnapped Lu Ningzhi

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.640
and sent threatening videos to the police.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.400
Chief Chang,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.370
I think it's time we bring him in for questioning.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.770
That could work.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880
It's a direction.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.560
Excuse me.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
Mr. Mo isn't here.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.040
You can't go in.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.040
Everyone,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.840
this is...

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.170
You're Mo Laoqi, right?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.360
You're a suspect in a kidnapping case.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.280
Come with us.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.520
Kidnapping?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.280
There must be some mistake.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.680
Factory building No. 14.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.480
You think covering your face

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.940
And disguising your voice

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.400
Would stop us from catching you?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.280
The problem is your escape technique is terrible,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.440
Full of holes.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280
Isn't that right?

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.760
Liu.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.480
No, no.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.880
This must be a misunderstanding.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.960
You've got the wrong person.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.159
It's a misunderstanding.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.360
We'll talk back at the station.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.220
Take them away.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.620
What are you doing?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.280
No!

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.700
What are you doing?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.240
Mr. Yang.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.170
Hello everyone.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.900
I'm Yang Zhiming, Chairman of Shengtian Group.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.440
Your employee is involved in a kidnapping case.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.100
Would you mind coming with me?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.520
Of course not.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.440
Cooperation between police and citizens is necessary.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.880
The entire Shengtian Group

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.540
will cooperate with the police investigation.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.250
You talk, I talk.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.120
Why don't I give you a chance

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.520
to confess voluntarily?

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.080
Confess what?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.880
I've already told you

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.340
it's a misunderstanding.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.840
Where were you on February 20th?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.360
Probably at the company,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.520
I don't remember.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880
That's not right.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.040
We checked the surveillance footage at Shengtian Group.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.570
You weren't there that day.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.080
Then I must have been out for business meetings.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.520
Who would specifically remember that?

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.120
You're being stubborn, aren't you?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.640
Your secretary told us.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.800
That day you specifically instructed her to stay at the office.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.600
You said you had personal matters.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.120
You told her not to follow you.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.120
What personal matters did you have?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.440
Let me remind you

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.200
about that taunting video you sent to the police.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.930
We've done further technical restoration on it.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.400
My colleague just informed me

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.800
that the restoration results are ready.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.440
Should I go get it now

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.120
and play it for you?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.480
Let you hear your own voice?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.040
Or will you confess now?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.480
Do you know Chi Xiao?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.320
Answer me.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.730
I don't know him.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.920
Tu Guolin, as Chi Xiao's pawn,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.680
after losing his usefulness,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.610
was hunted down and nearly killed.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.200
Now that we've caught you,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.080
to your superiors,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.960
you've also lost your value.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.400
From what I know about Mr. K,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.250
do you think his methods

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.480
would be more merciful than Chi Xiao's?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.640
And does Mr. K know

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.320
about your business dealings with Tu Guolin

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.580
using a fake identity?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.320
New debts,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.400
old debts,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.810
how do you think he'll settle with you?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.600
Yes.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.480
The kidnapping

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.960
was my doing.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.960
Here's your chance to redeem yourself.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.120
Where is Chi Xiao?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.240
Can we find her?

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.640
I didn't know at first.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.400
But just as you said,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.320
after she lost her usefulness,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.400
Mr. K abandoned her.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.440
So she wanted to cooperate with me

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.120
and asked me to meet at her domestic base.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.040
Of course I didn't agree.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.560
I didn't dare to.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.480
The factory incident

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.480
was also ordered by Mr. K.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.720
He's our group's chairman,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.840
Yang Zhiming.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.000
I didn't dare to refuse.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.360
You're saying Yang Zhiming is Mr. K?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.160
That's right.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.840
What evidence do you have

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.240
that Mr. K ordered you to do this?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.960
None.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.880
Mr. K is the type of person

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.800
who seems to know everything.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.680
I didn't dare keep any evidence.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.080
Chi Xia's previous

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.490
recusal request

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.380
was rejected by the provincial department.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.700
They really did reject it.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.560
I know you want Chi Xia involved in this case.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.160
The provincial department also stated that

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.080
Chi Xia is familiar with Old K's criminal organization

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.000
and its internal operations,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.400
so to solve this case,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.480
we also need Chi Xia's cooperation.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.920
Look how happy you are.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.720
But there's one condition:

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.920
all of Chi Xia's actions

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.360
must follow our commands.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.120
Don't worry,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.850
Chief Chang.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.320
Currently, we have

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640
two tasks ahead of us.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.400
First,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.200
arrest Chi Xiao.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.840
Second,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.240
investigate Shengtian Group.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.040
Cao Bin.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.040
You've encountered Fox before.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.920
Based on the address Mo Laoqi provided,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.680
keep a close eye on her

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.040
and make sure to track her location at all times,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.640
so that when we take action,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.320
we don't tip her off and end up empty-handed.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.960
Got it.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.760
Jue.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.120
You and Juanmao go investigate

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.200
Shengtian Group's recent business operations.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.000
Tax records

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.720
and recent business partners.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.400
Try to find evidence of criminal activity

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.360
to verify what Mo Laoqi said.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.640
Also,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.920
take a close look at

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.780
this new fake Old K who's shown up.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.760
I'll ask colleagues from Economic Crime Unit

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.840
to assist with your investigation.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.560
Okay.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.000
Captain Luo,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.960
maybe I should go with Jue to investigate Shengtian Group instead.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.280
To avoid any bias,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.040
I won't be at the arrest scene.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.240
Fine, no problem.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.200
Share your impression of Chi Xiao's personality

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.080
and behavioral patterns

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.280
with everyone

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.540
to help them track him.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.440
Bin,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.200
we've been watching for two days now.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.280
Don't even talk about seeing a fox.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.540
I haven't even spotted a single fox hair.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.840
She can't just not come back, right?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.080
Stop talking nonsense.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.880
Just keep watching as I told you.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.160
Bin.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.440
The fox has shown up.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.880
That's her.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.650
Captain Luo.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.680
She's back.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.440
Good.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.160
No problem.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.800
Let's go.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.080
Cao Bin has confirmed it.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.240
Chi Xiao has been at her hideout recently

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.200
We can proceed with the arrest.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.120
Notify all teams

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.800
to move in.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.200
Captain Luo.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.880
Chi Xiao must have realized she's being tracked.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.040
She's driving away now.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.100
I'm following her.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.320
The license plate is Dong E C4757,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.180
black vehicle.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.200
We're now on Wuxing Road,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.800
heading toward the suburbs.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.960
Brother.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.120
Go to Chi Xiao's place and intercept her,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.450
so she can't draw us away

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.440
and double back after losing us.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.600
Got it.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.880
Dong E·C4757.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.080
Captain Luo.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.140
We lost the target.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.490
You really are like a ghost that won't go away.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.160
Then in your next life, try to be reborn

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.640
in a world without me.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.610
And stop being someone else's shadow.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.700
Looks like your memory has returned.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.960
You killed my parents.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.200
That's right.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.370
I just wanted to see you suffer.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.600
Since childhood, you've always been different,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.040
pretending to be so righteous.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.160
Why should someone like you

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.040
get special treatment from Qu Bai?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.480
Why has Old K been searching for you for over a decade,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.760
desperately trying to awaken your memories?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.640
I'm clearly better than you.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.040
Why do you get all their

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.700
expectations and attention?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.960
You know what?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.360
You look like a clown now.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.800
You still don't understand.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.400
What Old K really wants.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.079
What you care about,

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.079
what you envy,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.319
what you desire,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.079
what you resent.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.359
These are all things I don't care about.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.920
Go to hell.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.920
Chi Xia.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.320
Do you know how helpless your parents were

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.640
when they died?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.000
The fire slowly peeled away their skin,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.240
no matter how loudly they screamed.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720
And you were far away in Qin City,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.920
just a fresh graduate from the police academy,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.320
unable to do anything.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.560
How disappointed your parents must be

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.240
in their only daughter.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.520
Chi Xia.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.680
You caused the death of so many people.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.080
Don't you deserve to die?

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.000
You still owe me two lives.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.480
You're a police officer.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.440
You can't kill.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.800
Then thank you for paving the way for me.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.060
My first-class merit.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.160
No one is above the law.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.800
Issue a wanted notice

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.080
for Chi Xia.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.160
You're a messenger of justice.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.400
You've come to arrest me for the police.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.200
You know that's not what I meant.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.280
I only hate myself

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.400
for not having the chance to kill you with my own hands.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.360
Deep down,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.770
you crave to commit crimes.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.040
We are the same kind.
