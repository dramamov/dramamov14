WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.440
Luo Xun

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.740
I suspect I've actually killed someone before.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.700
Taking personal revenge.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.400
Well,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
the fact that you're saying this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.000
means you definitely don't believe it's true.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.400
Actually, I've recovered quite a bit of my memory.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
The fox and I

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.560
come from the same place.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.400
Or rather,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
I am the real fox.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.760
In my memory,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.840
though it's blurry,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.920
I still feel it was hell.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.440
A group of children and I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.570
struggled in a hopeless elimination system.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.520
[Survival]

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.920
In punishment

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
and increasingly brutal training,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.840
over and over again.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320
They were a criminal organization.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.640
They forced me.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960
They forced me to kill.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.240
I don't know if I actually

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.960
carried out such acts

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.570
to complete my missions back then.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.570
I don't remember how I escaped either.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.770
If it weren't for my parents

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.040
adopting me

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.860
and taking good care of me,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.010
I wouldn't just be where I am today,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.860
I might even be standing against you.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.210
That's not true.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.260
I have a feeling

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.900
you wouldn't kill anyone.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.090
You have high moral standards.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.079
Although

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.480
you speak eloquently

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.610
when analyzing criminal psychology,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.360
if it were actually you,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.840
you could never cross that moral line.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.640
Listen,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.040
stop thinking about that criminal organization.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800
You're nothing like them.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.120
Whether you resent it

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.320
or hate it,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.730
just bring it down with your own hands.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.930
But my memory is still quite fuzzy now.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.000
Sometimes I'm completely lost.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.200
The point is, our enemy is hiding in the shadows,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.400
while we're exposed.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.800
Be careful.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.920
I'll be fine.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.450
It's you I'm worried about.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.920
Don't get trapped

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.320
in those insignificant memory fragments.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.610
Don't borrow anxiety from the future,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.850
and don't let them lead you by the nose.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.560
Break free.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.880
For everything else,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.970
let's just go with the flow.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.530
Chief Chang.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.000
I've already faxed you the case files from here.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.800
Yes.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.320
I see.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.080
Although Qu Feiyu has been caught,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.480
there are still some details of this case that aren't clear.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.640
The Wang Sheng that Tu Guolin mentioned

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.960
hasn't been found yet.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.210
The business card matter isn't resolved either.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.720
I'm requesting to stay in Yuji with Chi Xia for a few more days.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.320
Don't worry,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.980
we'll definitely be careful.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.040
Okay.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.820
Who's that?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.060
Who is this person?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.720
Stop!

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.840
Stop right there!

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.320
Who are you?

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.000
Stop!

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.610
Why are you running?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.720
Don't move! Let me go!

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.560
Why are you running?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.880
You're not from our Wang Village either.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.280
Tell us how you got in here.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.680
Tired of living, are you?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.920
Brother,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920
brother, you've misunderstood me.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
I'm here to do research.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.680
Research?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.880
You're talking nonsense.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.610
What's there to research here?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.760
It's getting dark,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.440
I

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.640
should be heading back.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960
Like hell you are!

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.920
Why are you hitting me?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.680
I'll hit you.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.320
What's wrong with me hitting you?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.200
Let me tell you.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.080
If you dare come again,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.680
I'll beat you every time I see you,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.600
baldy.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.130
Let's get out of here quick!

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.330
Get out! Go away!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.880
Alright, go back!

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.920
Get lost!

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.560
Captain Luo.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.000
I suspect Wang Sheng is hiding in Wang Village.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.680
The villagers aren't cooperating.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.140
I don't dare to act rashly.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.960
Okay.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.960
Find a place first.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.080
Don't alert them.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.210
We'll be there soon.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.360
Alright.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.280
Heizi must be right.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.240
This Wang Sheng

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.320
must be hiding somewhere in this village.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.080
Juanmao has confirmed the evidence.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.280
We'll arrest him on sight.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.920
Okay.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.880
Last night,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.720
these little punks beat me up.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.520
So what if we beat you?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.680
We went easy on you.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.520
Calm down.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.600
He's not even a cop.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.040
Everyone calm down.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.570
Is it wrong to catch a thief?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.800
Thief?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.480
What did he steal?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.880
Do you have any evidence?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.980
Beating someone up for no reason.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.520
All of you,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.720
each and every one,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.130
are coming back to the station with me.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.840
If you don't want to go to the station,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.360
then tell us everything right here.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.720
Is Wang Sheng from your village?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.120
Where are you hiding him?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.560
Officer,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.040
it's not a holiday or anything,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.240
why would he come back to the village?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.600
Did you see him yourself?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.120
That's right.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.520
We haven't seen him.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.780
Haven't seen him, huh?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.520
We'll search ourselves.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.960
What are you doing?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.370
What's the meaning of this?

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.890
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.180
You dare to get physical even though you're police?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.530
You think being police makes you special?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.680
I'm Chi Xia.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.560
It's like this.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.760
We have a suspect.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.080
He's hiding in Wang Village now.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.000
But the villagers aren't being cooperative.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.640
So our search is quite difficult.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.120
I saw at the village entrance

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.360
a construction team with your company's name.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.200
Then I remembered

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.720
you mentioned having cooperation with them.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.360
Right?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.680
Could you help us?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.120
The project in Wang Village

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.120
is indeed contracted by my company.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.160
The clan influence is very strong in that village.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.960
It's not surprising they protect each other.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.760
However,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.240
you can look for the head of the Third Branch.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.480
He's asked me for many favors.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.400
I'll put in a word,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.960
and he'll fully cooperate with your work.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.680
Great,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.000
thanks.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.770
I'm only telling you this because of Director Qu.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.000
Don't tell them everything.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.240
But you must promise me

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.800
never to tell anyone

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.920
that I was the one who told you.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.120
Otherwise, in this village,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.380
I won't be able to stay.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.320
Don't worry.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.039
East Village Road, Number 12.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.400
That's Wang Sheng's uncle's house.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.600
I'll have my son

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.919
take you there shortly.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.200
Go get my son quickly.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.360
Hurry up!

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.480
It's that house up ahead

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.410
where someone is washing clothes.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.760
I'd better not show my face.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.020
I'll wait for you here.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.760
It's fine.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.600
You don't need to wait here either.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.480
You can go back first.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.120
Thank you.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.920
No problem.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.520
Let's go.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.160
Move.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000
Captain Luo,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.760
Wang Sheng isn't at his uncle's house.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.440
He's hiding at the neighbor's house across the street.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.240
What?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.080
How do you know?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.720
That homeowner wasn't lying,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.240
but they had a backup plan.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.840
His wife just quietly used their dialect

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.040
to tell Wang Sheng to hide at the neighbor's house across the street.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.100
Someone's coming.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.000
Listen to me.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.330
I guarantee it's right.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.760
Don't stay at your uncle's house.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.920
Quickly find somewhere to hide.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.440
Just do as I say.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.120
Don't come out until I call for you.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.450
But I didn't expose him.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.520
I thought we could trap him inside.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.520
Turn the tables on him.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.280
I was wondering

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.920
why his son was so nervous on the way here.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.780
So he was trying to keep tabs on us.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.520
What are we waiting for?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.400
Let's get him!

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.200
Don't move!

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.240
Police!

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.770
Get down!

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.020
Hands on your head!

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.260
Are you Wang Sheng?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.080
Mr. Tu,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.680
what's the plan?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.600
Why such a hurry?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.320
Wang Sheng has been arrested.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.720
I need to hide in the mountains for a few days.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.480
You have to come with me.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.360
We leave now.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.040
But

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.970
our car is still at the repair shop.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.040
Why don't I make a call now?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.970
There's no time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The police could be here any minute.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.000
Let's go straight to the shop and take it.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.640
Let's go.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.440
Mr. Li.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.720
Mr. Tu is here.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840
The car is fixed.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.480
It's ready for you.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.840
Take a look.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.440
Good.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.280
Why are there so many people today?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.840
It's fine.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.970
They're our people.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.760
Mr. Tu.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.160
I finally caught you.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.760
Help me out.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.760
Ten times the medical expenses.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.560
Through the back door.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.200
Thanks.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.000
Boys,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.400
troublemakers are here.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.200
Come over.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Don't move!

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.880
Nobody move!

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.640
Freeze!

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.480
Tell me the truth

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.210
about Mo Laoqi and Tu Guolin's secret collusion.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.160
That's good.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.280
Well done.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.320
You're trying to make up for your mistakes.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.320
At least

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.610
the group's efforts

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.880
invested in you weren't wasted.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.920
I've invited them over for a meeting.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.090
I'm here to see K.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.440
Please wait outside.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.370
K is still handling some business.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.600
Mr. Qu.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.440
De.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.820
Brother Seven.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.520
K rarely invites us to this place.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.180
Why did he suddenly ask us to come here today?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.480
No idea.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.340
Is it just the two of us?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.600
Has Chi Xiao arrived?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.520
Probably.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.840
Recently,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Chi Xiao and K have been meeting more and more frequently.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.960
Their private dealings haven't stopped either.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.120
I knew it.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.720
She's been so secretive these past six months.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.640
I get angry just hearing about her.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640
Damn it.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.760
K wouldn't make her his successor, would he?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.880
All these years,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.600
even if I haven't made great achievements,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.000
I've still put in the hard work.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.520
And now I end up being her errand boy.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.240
Don't tell me you're still in the dark.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.090
What's really going on?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.170
Tell your brother everything.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.320
Besides me,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.600
no one will know.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.760
The details...

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.970
I'm not sure either.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.960
But a few days ago at the Yuji Hotel,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.600
Chi Xiao tried to assassinate Chi Xia.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.120
She wants to kill Chi Xia?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.410
Isn't Chi Xia...

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.360
Does she dare?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.520
Right under my nose,

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.440
she's being so arrogant,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.770
without any restraint.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.240
I advise you

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440
to be careful.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.680
If she dares to touch Chi Xia,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.000
who knows when

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.840
she'll see us as obstacles too.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.970
Don't you think?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.360
You two got here quite early.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.280
Why don't you go in?

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.920
Wait for me!

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.600
Qubai.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.440
You may go in now.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.080
De.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.220
Go back and wait for me.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.280
This is

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.170
trying to kill this person!

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.730
Just crippling one leg.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.680
Qubai.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.490
I was hoping you would take more care of the group.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.600
But instead,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.880
you're always out there taking it easy.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.340
I have to deal with all these random people who sneak in myself.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.700
Isn't it time you got serious?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.720
This is your group.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.080
I work under you.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.320
So naturally I don't care about it as much as you do.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You certainly know where you stand.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.680
Doing business with Tu Guolin behind my back.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.520
I really underestimated you,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.320
Mo Laoqi.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.200
After so many years in the group,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.330
if you want to leave,

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.720
just say so.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.760
Yes,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.280
I was greedy.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.920
You punishing me

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.960
is justified.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.370
But you must believe me,

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.500
at least I would never betray you.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.320
Unlike some people.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.360
Loyal on the surface.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.320
But behind

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.180
the scenes, stabbing Chi Xia in the back.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.560
No denial?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.580
So you admit it.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.040
I...

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.970
I was just catching up with her.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.560
The same thing.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.880
I don't want to hear it again.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.600
Understand?

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.400
Yes.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.770
Everyone get up.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Your old friend at the police station

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.360
has something I need.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.920
You all know

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080
what to do, right?

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.200
Understood.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.020
If there's a next time,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.220
you'll get more than just a whipping.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.160
You may go.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.280
Mo Laoqi,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.640
stay.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.200
Lin Yushan, male.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.000
Lin Yushan.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.720
Female.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.480
You know what to do

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.160
now, right?

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.680
Don't worry.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.720
Here,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.520
take a look.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.800
This is evidence of you taking kickbacks

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.320
and transferring assets at Tu Guolin's company.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.000
We've also confirmed with the workers

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.520
that you attempted to destroy

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.450
the crime scene at Bailong Resort.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.920
Officer,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.680
if I confess everything now,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.920
would it still count as turning myself in?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.720
It's too late,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.720
but if you make a significant contribution,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.840
you could get a reduced sentence.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.640
Listen,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.010
I had nothing to do with the murder.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.800
Someone forced me to do it all.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.640
Speak up.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.440
Make it clear.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.040
When Mr. Tu first asked me

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.240
to develop the Yuji Adventure project,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.640
I did get greedy

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.329
and handed the project operations to Liu.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.400
I made quite a profit from it.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.119
But I was very discreet about it.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.359
Who would have thought

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.359
a woman would suddenly show up at my door a few days ago.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.920
She knew everything

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.680
and threatened me to follow her orders.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.200
Then...

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.460
What did she look like?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.520
I don't know.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.130
She was wearing sunglasses and a mask.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.360
But she must be pretty

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.360
and had a nice figure.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.800
And...

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.400
What are you mumbling about?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.080
Do you know

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.840
her name?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.040
No.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.120
Is it her?

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.520
I'm not sure.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.210
But it looks quite similar.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.620
Continue with your story.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.640
Then she asked me to tell Mr. Tu

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.820
that someone had died at Bailong Resort.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.280
She claimed the corpse was holding Mr. Tu's business card.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.410
She insisted I must lure Mr. Tu to Yuji.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.080
I didn't believe it at first.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.760
But I couldn't just lie to Mr. Tu, right?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.080
So I went to Bailong Resort to check.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.160
That abandoned building,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.720
the door was half open.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.000
The room inside was locked from within.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.080
I peeked through the small window.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.840
To my surprise, there really was a dead body inside.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.920
After telling Mr. Tu, I got more and more scared.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.800
So I...

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.160
I just ran away.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.280
Did this woman contact you afterward?

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.080
No.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.680
But she lied to me too.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.480
What the corpse was holding

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.200
wasn't Mr. Tu's business card at all.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.360
It was a fox-shaped keychain.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.400
Are you sure it was a fox-shaped keychain?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.920
Absolutely certain.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.080
It seems now

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.120
that Fox's plot in Yuji

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.080
was meant to kill two birds with one stone.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.640
The criminal organization behind Chi Xiao

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.170
must be quite substantial.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.280
This afternoon I saw Old Mo Seven go to Bailong Resort.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.680
He said he installed a homemade bomb in the room.
