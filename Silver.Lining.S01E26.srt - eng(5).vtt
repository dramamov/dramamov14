00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120
She's out of danger now.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.000
But as for when she'll regain consciousness,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.930
it will definitely take some time.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.400
The specific situation

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.120
depends on her will to live

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.520
and physical condition.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.840
Thank you.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.480
If anything happens,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.000
please contact the police immediately.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Okay.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.880
No signs of forced entry.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.840
No evidence of external damage either.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.180
This indicates

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.660
the killer definitely entered using the passcode.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520
I've already reviewed

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.320
the fire department's footage.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.680
Fang Xiaofeng died right here.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.570
Dong Chengbin died at the doorway.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.840
This means

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.039
the killer was in the middle of the crime

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.880
when they happened to run into Dong Chengbin,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.240
so they silenced him.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.600
This makes logical sense.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.400
Zhu Chongliang must have witnessed everything.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.200
Yes.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960
But the surveillance footage shows

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.160
no suspicious individuals

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.560
ever entered Building 8.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.600
That's strange.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280
Tomorrow when the property management is working,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
I'll have Curly come check the surveillance footage.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.440
Why did you buy so many things?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.300
Are they heavy?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.120
It's fine.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.400
You should have asked me first.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.000
My fridge can't fit all this.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.680
I bought what seemed useful.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.320
How can we eat all of this?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.120
These items have a long shelf life.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.480
Let's eat the fruit first.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.280
Okay.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.680
These are

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.740
all Xiao Fang's favorite dishes.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.520
He was so young.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.520
Such a pity.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.930
Eat something, Mom.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.960
I don't understand

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.090
how you can act like nothing happened.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.860
He was your husband after all.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.040
How could you?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.840
Mom.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.240
Since when did you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.960
start caring about our relationship?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960
I had no idea.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.020
It was an accident, wasn't it?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.810
I'm just worried about you.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560
How will you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.760
manage on your own?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.560
I'll live just like

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.560
you've been living all these years.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.460
Long-term surveillance.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.120
Captain Luo.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.279
The diary

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.540
is written like a mundane log.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.720
See this?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.130
This guy's crush is Lu Ningzhi.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.880
That bastard from 602

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.620
actually bullied her.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.970
I really hate myself

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.020
for not being able to help her.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.040
I'm useless.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.600
So useless.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.050
That guy named Fang.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.680
You're in cahoots with that bastard from 602,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.280
Fang Xiaofeng,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.409
you'll pay for this!

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
If I see you hit her again,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240
I'll kill you myself!

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.400
It seems the scenes Zhu Chongliang described

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.760
actually happened.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.360
But in his mind,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.280
the timeline got scrambled.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.920
That's why

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.500
he can only remember the things he hates.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.480
This Zhu Chongliang,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.250
since he had been stalking for a long time,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.440
it's not surprising

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.700
that he became a witness to this case.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.240
I think

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.000
after manipulating the unpredictable Zheng Lanshu once,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.640
the Fox wouldn't choose someone like Zhu Chongliang

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.920
as a scapegoat again.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.040
Maybe Zhu Chongliang

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.440
was just traumatized after witnessing it,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.480
mistakenly believing he killed someone,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.340
which is why he turned himself in.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.400
It seems we need to

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.530
have another meeting with Lu Ningzhi.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.280
Sir,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.200
what's the situation?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.880
Sir,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.940
I think there's something suspicious about this fire.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.570
I'm asking about Chi Xia's condition.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.080
Chi Xia is safe for now

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.840
with no unusual circumstances.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.880
Don't leave yet.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.080
Wait until they've gone before you leave,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.140
in case someone tries to harm Chi Xia.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.080
Understood.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.680
Zhu Chongliang's examination results are in.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.080
He does have mental abnormalities

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.600
and below-average intelligence.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.480
He's awake now,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.000
but his emotions are still unstable.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.200
I've arranged for someone to watch him.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.080
At this point,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.640
there's not much value in questioning Zhu Chongliang again.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.320
We need to find a new lead.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.300
What's the situation with Chen Lingxin?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.640
Chen Lingxin has a new boyfriend now

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.600
named Tao Han.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.640
What do you mean?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.360
Well,

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:52.159
Tao Han's father

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.680
caused a traffic accident five years ago

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.810
that killed Lu Ningzhi's stepfather.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.130
What a coincidence.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.840
Quite the coincidence indeed.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.760
Currently, Jue and I suspect

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.600
that Chen Lingxin,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.760
unable to bear Fang Xiaofeng's deception,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.160
threatened to burn Fang Xiaofeng to death,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.520
then used Tao Han, who has a grudge against Lu Ningzhi's family,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.920
to take revenge on Fang Xiaofeng's family.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.210
Do you know this person?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.160
Yes, I do.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.480
Just acquaintances.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.000
Or like Dong Chengbin?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.640
Just nodding acquaintances.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.840
Just acquaintances,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.680
neighbors several doors apart.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.200
He lives in 606.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.040
You seem to know quite a bit about him.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.500
I'm not interested in him,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.900
he's interested in me.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.600
I know he used to peep

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.159
and stalk me.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.159
I see.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.760
Thank you.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.280
In his statement,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.760
we found some information.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.120
It says you and

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.050
Dong Chengbin had some issues.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.680
About that,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.000
I don't want to talk about it.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.640
Dong Chengbin assaulted me before.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.040
He saw it.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.680
Does Fang Xiaofeng know?

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.640
He knows.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.919
He has more than once

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.100
used this incident

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.200
to blackmail Dong Chengbin.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.440
I really

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.120
just want to live

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.600
a peaceful life.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.040
But for some reason,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.530
things never go as planned.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.280
Why didn't you

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.000
tell us about this last time?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.610
I didn't want to mention it.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.820
It's not something to be proud of.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.650
Who wants to reopen old wounds?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.600
Why don't you divorce him?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.970
You could live peacefully on your own.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.480
I told you last time,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.520
I can't leave him.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.660
What exactly can't you leave behind?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.840
When I married him,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.690
my mother strongly opposed it.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.520
I once used the most vicious words

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.380
to mock her two failed marriages.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.880
If I get divorced,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.680
I'll become just like my mother.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.040
I would lose.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.080
I don't want to lose.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.280
How much do you know about Fang Xiaofeng's affair?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.680
Nothing.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.650
Not interested.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.640
Do you remember

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.800
the traffic accident that killed your stepfather

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.000
five years ago?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.160
Yes.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.880
The driver's son

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.620
was my high school classmate,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.720
Tao Han.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.660
Have you kept in touch since then?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.880
Back then,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.080
his father was charged with a traffic offense.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Before the trial,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.000
Tao Han knelt down and begged me to forgive his father

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.460
and not send him to prison.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.080
But the law is the law.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.680
There was nothing I could do.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.840
Tao Han seemed

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.500
resentful about the verdict.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.240
Later I heard

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.440
he went abroad.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.810
What do you think about what Lu Ningzhi just said?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.730
I don't think she's making up her experience.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.080
It's just that she gives me a feeling...

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.100
How should I put it?

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.960
I'm the one asking questions,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.490
but she's the one controlling the situation.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.120
I found it.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.920
This Tao Han returned to China

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.200
half a month ago, just days before the New Year,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.280
already.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.660
Here's his itinerary.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.730
So from what we know now,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.280
there's a possibility that Tao Han

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.520
is seeking revenge against Lu Ningzhi's family.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.920
Was Dong Chengbin really killed

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.200
because he witnessed Tao Han committing murder

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200
and had to be silenced?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.080
Then what about Zhu Chongliang?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.560
How did he manage to witness everything

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.090
and still remain unharmed?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.660
Are you suggesting

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.040
that Dong Chengbin's death

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.520
wasn't because he witnessed Fang Xiaofeng's murder?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.400
Hard to say.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.400
Regarding Chen Lingxin's suspicion,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.000
I now have a different perspective.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.800
Just tell me.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.480
This girl Chen Lingxin,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.640
despite her young age,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.840
has quite an extensive dating history.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.280
In just the past three years,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.360
we've verified that

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.560
she's had double-digit official relationships.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.320
Half a month ago,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.920
she just broke up with Fang Xiaofeng.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.680
Three days later,

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.880
she got together with her current boyfriend,

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.240
who is Tao Han.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.720
According to people close to Chen Lingxin,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.600
this girl

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.840
comes from a wealthy family

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.520
and her personality is

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.850
outgoing and cheerful.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.520
She just has this habit of

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.960
threatening her ex-boyfriends when they break up.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.400
It's only to embarrass them.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.160
She has never actually

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
followed through with her threats.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.000
And soon after,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.440
she would start a new relationship.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.900
I think a girl like this...

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.720
She wouldn't go to extremes

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.960
over an ex-boyfriend.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.240
And this doesn't really match the Fox's

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.940
criteria for selecting criminal accomplices.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560
Now Tao Han is the only suspect left.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.160
I think he's a valid suspect.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.000
Being dissatisfied with his father's verdict

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.400
is a motive for the crime.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.160
Getting close to Chen Lingxin

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.360
was to learn about Lu Ningzhi's family.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760
If the Fox is involved in this case,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.720
he also fits the Fox's criteria

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.780
for choosing someone to manipulate.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.720
That's all for today.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.850
Thank you everyone.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.400
Thank you for your hard work, teacher.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:00.920
It's no trouble at all.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.160
You all did great.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.600
Why are you here?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.640
I came to congratulate Coach Lu

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.600
on completing your first personal training session.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.730
How did you know I had a personal training session today?

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.200
You referred the client.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.480
Why did you do this?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.320
I want to witness and be part of

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.650
every step in your life.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.820
Whether it's the past,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.960
the present,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.440
or the future.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.560
Tao Han.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.600
Thank you,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.760
but it's no use.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.960
I don't believe that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.520
You know about my family situation.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.240
I don't care.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.040
My stepfather...

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.160
I'm not him.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.120
Don't you understand?

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.720
Between us,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.520
it's my issue,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520
not yours.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.890
My mother remarried when I was very young.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.400
I grew up with my stepfather's

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.160
alcoholism and domestic violence.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.960
Towards men,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.880
I only feel hatred and disgust.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.240
In my memory,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240
men have only brought me pain.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.320
I can't bring myself

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.880
to trust or rely on any man.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.140
Don't you understand?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.480
Ningzhi.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.080
Ningzhi.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.720
Not all men are like your stepfather.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.880
I want to be someone you can trust,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.340
someone who protects you.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.640
Today's private lesson was just a small thing,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.200
but it represents that I can

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.320
stand up for you when you need me.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.480
I can do anything

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.200
you need me to do for you.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.880
If you don't bring me the money tomorrow,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.140
I'll beat you to death.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.920
Always crying.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.520
I'll beat you to death!

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.240
Get out!

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.400
Let me go!

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.200
I'll kill you!

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.560
Still trying to run?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.960
I'll show you what happens when you run.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.040
Marrying your mother

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.000
was the worst mistake of my life.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.730
I'll beat you

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240
for running away.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.980
Running again?

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.880
I'll kill you!

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.940
I'll beat you to death!

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320
I'll destroy you!

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560
I'm in trouble.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.420
Binjiang Road Reservoir Bridge.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.400
Come quickly.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.040
Dad.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.200
Are you okay?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.440
I'm here.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.960
I'm here.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.970
I'm with you.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.440
I'm with you.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.840
I'm here.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.560
Ningzhi.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.400
Ningzhi.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.080
Ningzhi.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.360
I just wanted to

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.339
teach him a lesson for you.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.000
I

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.579
didn't expect this to happen.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.079
How dare you?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.800
He's my father.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.119
When I was pouring the wine,

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.359
I accidentally knocked the bottle.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.400
Did I scare you?

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.770
Mom, what are you doing with that wine?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.290
Since you rarely come back,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.800
let's make an offering to him.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.130
It's been so many years.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.420
Let's not hold grudges against the dead.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.120
He drank so much when he was alive

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.720
and still wasn't satisfied.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.570
Now you want him to keep drinking after death?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.720
What did you see?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.120
I... I saw

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.520
she was bullied.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.200
Is Chi Xiao going

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.860
to use fire again for his plan?

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.680
25

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.360
25

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.480
