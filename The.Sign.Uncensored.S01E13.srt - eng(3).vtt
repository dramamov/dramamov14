00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.480
(phone ringing)

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960
(phone ringing)

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.520
(phone ringing)

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.200
They’re here?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.360
That’s fast. Your men really did a great job, Inspector Akk.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.360
Where are they?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.440
If you want your friends back, you must do as I say.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.320
What do you want?

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.400
Michael’s daughter.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.680
How do I know you wouldn’t betray me?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640
I’ll let 3 of them go.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.320
But if you don’t do as I say,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.080
the rest of them won’t go out of here alive.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.800
Where do you want me to meet you?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.080
At the border.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.800
How’s Michael?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.440
Guys! Inspector! Singh!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.840
Thongthai

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000
Thongthai. Thongthai.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.800
Thongthai.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.920
The Sign

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.760
Tharn, are you alright?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.200
I’m okay.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.400
I might have been working too hard lately.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.040
I even dreamt about the case we’re working on.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.880
Oh, poor you, my bolster.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.000
Next time, if you don’t want to have a bad dream, just dream about me.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.160
Got it?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.920
Yeah.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.560
Morning kiss.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.440
Ummm

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.640
Ummm

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.600
That’s enough.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
Go shower now.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.720
We have to go to work.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.040
Ummm

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.760
Hmmm

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What do want?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.880
The first one was just a morning kiss.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.360
But this is a morning sex.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.120
What you just saw is a video clip about Michael’s case.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800
He’s a programmer who looks after the system for an online gambling website.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.800
A foreign mafia gang is after him right now…

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.880
due to a conflict about the online gambling site.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.880
So, he ran away to hide out here.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.560
Two days ago, Michael was abducted from the hotel on Sukhumvit road.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.720
We found evidence as a video clip on his daughter’s phone.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.400
She must have filmed it secretly.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.400
It has led us to the culprit.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.680
Have the police found out who took him?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.960
They believe the mafia gang has hired Saeng to do this dirty job.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.760
One of the culprits has a spider tattoo.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.159
This confirms that he’s one of Saeng’s gunmen.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.440
But aren’t all cases about (Village Chief) Saeng under Captain Achara’s responsibility?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.520
Yeah, why transfer it to us all of the sudden?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.800
Isn’t her team working on the online gambling website and (Village Chief) Saeng cases?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.720
I never thought you’re a thief in disguise,
Captain stealing other people’s cases like this.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.400
I thought we’ve already settled this in the meeting.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.800
Leave the case.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.040
I’m the one who started this case, so I’ll be the one who close it.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.880
I’m just doing my job doing what I’ve been assigned to do.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.440
If you want this case back, go file a petition to the authority.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.000
If the authority approves, then I’ll leave the case immediately.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.800
But right now, this case is mine.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.400
It’s under my responsibility.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.760
I heard the authority is worried that you’d ruin this case

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.280
because you’re unable to separate your personal matter from work.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.920
I guess that must be true.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.600
I never do that.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.360
What about when you disobeyed the unit’s order…

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.320
and arrest Saeng without permission?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.600
Wasn’t that aroused by your personal matter?!

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.480
Instead of acting like a child and trying to get your candy back,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.200
you should rather go take care of your team and apologize to them…

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.720
for almost getting them killed.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.200
(phone ringing)

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.000
Yes, Miss Mayris?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.800
Yes, I’ll inform the Inspector right the way.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.680
Inspector, the witness in Saeng’s case has arrived.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.440
Should we go now?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.920
I have a job to do.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.680
- Looks like Captain isn’t going to take it easy on us.
- None of your business.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.280
Your job is to work on this case and protect the witness.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
(Crying)

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.480
Is she a witness in this case?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.640
Yes, her name is Deeni. She’s Michael’s daughter.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.200
Wait. According to the case file,
it says his daughter had run away and got killed by a car.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.400
That’s what the police wants everyone to believe. It’s for her own safety.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.360
On the way here, Deeni said that she wants to see her dad.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.000
She wants to help him rather than staying here.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.120
All right everyone, please don’t worry.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.640
Inspector, can I go talk to her?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.360
She must be so scared. Luckily, I’m good with kids.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.960
It’s all right, Deeni.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.160
(Crying)
It’s okay.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.720
(Crying)

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.640
(Crying)

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.080
(Crying)
It’s all right.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.240
(Crying)

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.800
(Crying)
I shouldn't be here, just let me go.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.080
(Crying)
It’s okay.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.200
(Crying)
Okay.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.600
Do you understand what she just said?

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.160
(Crying)
Hmm, no.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.960
Deeni, don’t worry. We’ll take your father back safely, okay?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.000
(Crying)

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.720
(Crying)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.040
Phaya and Tharn, take Deeni to your place and look after her.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.240
Don’t let her out of your sight until this case is solved and we can get Michael back.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.200
I’ll put both of you on vacation.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.760
- But… / - Yes, sir.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.320
(Crying)

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.280
(Crying)

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.040
Hey Deeni,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.440
my name is Tharn.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.320
You are going to be safe, you don’t have to worry.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.840
- Ouch! / - Tharn.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.360
What’s wrong?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.080
Tharn.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.800
You haven’t had a vision for quite some time, have you?

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.760
Why start seeing it again all of the sudden?

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.080
I don’t know why it’s happening again.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.880
But I can feel there must be something very dangerous about this case.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.920
I want you guys to be very careful.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.880
Don’t worry about me.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.320
Apart from the Abbot, I also have my wife as my guardian angels.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.600
Look at you.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.720
Why are you so worried about me?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.320
Geez, that’s enough. Let him go.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.640
I can take care of him. He’s my man.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.880
Hey, I’m your bro.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.480
- But he’s mine. / - Fine.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.800
Tharn, I think you’ve been working on a lot of serious cases lately.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.720
That’s why you’re getting tensed up so easily.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440
Guys!

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.760
I’ve got some interesting news.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.600
It’s about the bad-ass Inspector and the hot-tempered Captain.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.560
I found out why they don’t like each other.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.160
Why?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.480
Well, it’s because…

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.240
- Let me tell them.
- Go on, Baby.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.680
These two have been rivals since when they were still in college.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.280
When they first became a team leader here,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.160
they even fought over the team members.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.480
But I heard that no one wanted to be on Captain’s team.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.120
Probably because she’s a lady.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.640
I can’t believe there are still people who think that men are better than women.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.680
What a discrimination. Why judging others by their gender…

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.400
rather than by their abilities?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:46.600
It’s so irrational to judge others by their appearance or by their gender.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.360
Because we live in a pretentious society.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.440
That freedom and equality that you’re dreaming of…

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.760
So, Captain Achara wants to take Saeng’s case back so badly…

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.520
because she wants to prove that she is also capable to work on the case like the Inspector.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.040
That’s not it. Village Chief Saeng is involved in her father’s death.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.360
Here’s the story.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.680
Captain’s father comes from a hill tribe family.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.440
One day,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760
her father went into the woods to find food.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.320
There, he saw the village chief and his men illegally cut down the trees.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.240
So, he went to inform the authority.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.840
When Saeng and his men found out,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.920
they burnt down the Captain’s village.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.160
Only the Captain survived.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.960
That’s why she wanted to become a cop.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.680
She wants to arrest Saeng with her own hands.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.840
What are you guys doing? Get to work now.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.640
Yes, sir.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.040
(Sigh)

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.920
(Sigh)

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.120
Please take good care of Deeni for me.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.080
When she’s feeling better, try getting something out of her.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.880
Deeni might have some information that’s useful for the case.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.480
Yes, sir.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.960
Go get ready now.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.000
Mayris, can you lip-read what the culprit is talking to Michael?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.920
- Fa…
- Fashion Island.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:16:59.920
I’m sorry.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.480
Where’s my flash drive?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.720
Flash drive?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.000
What flash drive?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.839
Don’t lie.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.359
Where’s my flash drive?

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.359
Michael said, ‘I don’t know’.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.440
This is the conversation between Michael and the culprit.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.120
Who gives you permission to watch this clip?

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.720
It says in there that I have to help your team on this case.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.320
I’m just doing my job what I’ve been assigned to do.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.240
I hope you wouldn’t mind, Inspector.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.600
First round, Captain won.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.960
You’ve never changed.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.040
Stubborn, hotheaded, and never follow the rules.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.760
I think the Inspector won in this round.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.320
That’s right, I’m still the same.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.760
Just like you, who are still heartless the devil of our unit.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.240
What a hook. I’d say it’s a knockout.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.440
Now, please tell me everything you know so far.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.600
- Thongthai. / - Yes, sir.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.400
After a thorough investigation at the crime scene,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.120
we found out that a room next to Michael’s…

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.920
had been reserved 2 days prior to Michael’s check-in date.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.120
So, I checked the security camera.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.080
and it turned out the guest in that room was Saeng.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.120
About the flash drive…

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.000
It probably contains data about the online gambling sites.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.640
And a list of money laundering accounts.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.320
Michael must have kept it as evidence to protect himself and his daughter.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.800
Go check the case file if there’s any flash drive found at the crime scene.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.120
She doesn’t eat anything.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.200
And doesn’t say anything.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.800
Tharn, when you’re around Deeni…

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.200
do you see any vision?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.480
Not at all.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:10.160
Then I guess we won’t be able to get anything useful for the case from her.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.200
She is probably still in a trauma so she fears to trust others.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.240
It’s like when I lost my parents.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.720
I was like this too.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.080
When I grew up and lost my loved one,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.080
I thought I had overcome it.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.400
But then it came back.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.120
Fortunately, I had Chalothorn to save me.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.760
Hey.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.640
What?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.000
What’s wrong with you?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.720
What was that last sentence you just said?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.960
I said, ‘Luckily, I had Chalothorn to save me.’.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.760
Haven’t we talked about this?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.640
That we won’t mention him ever again.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.760
If you do,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.280
I’ll punish you like this.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.360
Hey.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.720
It’s all in the past.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.920
Why are you still being so jealous?!

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.800
Well, you have your own sixth sense.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.000
I also have mine.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.760
But it only works with you.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.760
I can’t help. I’m jealous.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.520
I’m jealous because I love you.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.320
Tharn.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.320
Promise me that you want mention him again.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.400
Say after me.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.320
I won’t mention him again.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.720
Fine.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.800
I won’t mention him again.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.800
Phaya.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.320
Hey!

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.360
What is it, now?

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.200
What if Grandma and Nee see us?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.640
They won’t.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.840
I told them…

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.440
to go get some fresh air at Huahin.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.840
So, it’s just us now.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.960
(Screaming)

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.720
Deeni!

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.600
(Crying)

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.440
Let’s go!

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.800
Where’s she?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.880
(Crying)

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.400
(Crying)

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.240
Do you want to drink something warm?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.640
Don’t worry, Deeni.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.320
It’s just a dream.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.400
(Cat meowing)
Namani wants to be your friend.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.760
You can give him a hug, okay?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.200
(Cat meowing)

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.680
(Cat meowing)

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.760
(Cat meowing)

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.400
Namami.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.280
(Cat meowing)

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.920
Do you think my dad is still alive?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.440
I’m sure your dad will try to do everything to stay alive.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.200
He must miss you so much.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.320
So, he will definitely come back to see you.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.240
I know my dad did the wrong things but no matter what he’s still my dad.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.160
Even he’s a bad person for someone else,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:52.720
but for me he’s the only person I have in my family.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.840
It’s true that your dad does something wrong
and for that he must be punished by the laws.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.080
But now he’s the one who needs help.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.800
And as a police officer,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.960
it is our job to protect your father as he’s also one of the citizens.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.160
Don’t worry, Deeni.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.000
I’ll do everything to get him back.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:56.000
That’s right. Don’t you worry. We will be right outside.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.240
Okay?

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:27.000
When I was young, Mummy and Daddy would hold me if I couldn’t sleep.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.360
Can you both please stay with me?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.360
Hey, if Mummy is sleepy…

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.680
then just go to bed first.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.840
Daddy will take care of her.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.000
Aren’t you a bit too full of yourself?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.640
I can be a Daddy too.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.960
You’re a Mummy.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.920
Okay.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.600
Mummy will do everything as Daddy says.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.840
Hmm

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.600
By the way, Daddy.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.360
I think I’m falling in love with Deeni.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.640
What if Mummy wants to have a cute baby like her…

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.760
what would you say?

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.520
Maybe in the next life.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.080
- You, evil Mummy jellyfish!
- Ouch!

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.920
Keep it down. She’s sleeping.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.840
Shut up.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.160
Mummy. Daddy.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.200
Umm

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.560
Why am I still dreaming of this place?

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.000
It’s been a long time, Sakuna-nopparuj.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.600
How did you know my name?

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.600
Can’t you remember me?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.520
Who are you?

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.160
You should be more polite to your older brother.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.240
Brother?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.440
You died because you stole a lover from Chalothorn.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.480
So did Wansarut.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.720
She died because she tried to save you.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.720
I’m here to congratulate you.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.000
That you can finally be with Wansarut.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.440
If you’re really my brother,

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.200
why didn’t you help me back then?

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.400
I have always helped you…

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.520
as much as the time loop would allow me to come through to this world and help you.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.080
But it’s you who have created all these problems.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.400
So, you must be the one to fix them.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.360
All the bonds and promises you have made with Wansarut…

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.120
prevent me from helping you as much as you might want to.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.600
But why now? What brings you here this time?

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.560
I’m here to warn you.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.680
You must be careful.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.440
Warn me?

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.960
Garuda and Naka are not supposed to live together.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.480
Those who try to go against the law of nature…

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.040
must sacrifice something in return.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.160
If you’re away from Wansarut,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.920
your power will decrease.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.040
So, no matter what happens…

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.200
don’t stay away from each other.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.920
Phaya.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.640
Hey!

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.680
Answer the call.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.720
Yeah.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.719
Phaya.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.760
Yes, Inspector?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.560
Saeng abducted Michael because he wants the flash drive that contains data about the online gambling sites.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.400
Flash drive?

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.000
Who has the flash drive right now?

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.199
We haven’t found it.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.400
Try asking Deeni if she ever saw her father keeping a flash drive anywhere in his house.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:34.920
Yes, sir.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.360
Let me know as soon as you find out.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.199
I’m taking our team to Chiangmai.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.480
Wait, Inspector.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.920
Where are you and your team going?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.560
Chiangmai.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.960
Our informant said they have located Saeng’s hideout.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.120
I’m taking my team there.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.120
Let me go with you.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.760
I might be able to help you find the route to get to Saeng’s hideout.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.240
It’s a place I’m familiar with because I grew up there.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.320
Please, Inspector.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.920
You should know how I feel.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.640
You also tried to give your brother justice, didn’t you?

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.080
Then, wait until I have my man disguised as one of Saeng’s henchmen.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.720
For now, I want you to send some officers to keep their eyes on Phaya’s place. It’s where Deeni is right now.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.920
Saeng is looking for a flash drive.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.920
That kid is still in danger.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.600
But I…

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.280
Hey

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.920
Are you still worried about your dream?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.360
Yeah.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.360
But deep down, I don’t want to believe it.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.880
It’s been a while since I last dreamt of something strange like this.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.360
Then this one might be true.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.920
We better be careful anyway.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.360
But right now, I think we better ask Deeni about that flash drive.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.280
Drink as much as you want, Deeni.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.000
After this, let’s go shower and go to bed.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.520
Deeni, can I ask you something?

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.080
Have you ever helped your day…

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.080
when he’s working at home?

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.280
Yes. I help making coffee for him in the morning.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.160
Sometimes, I also help tidy up his work desk.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.000
What about when you were at the hotel?

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.720
Did you also help tidy up his work desk there?

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.400
Did you ever see him keep something important in that desk?

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.600
Something like a flash drive.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.800
Flash drive?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.200
Can you remember it?

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.800
No, nothing like that.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.040
I’ve never seen him kept a flash drive anywhere.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.640
What about an item or something important that your dad has asked you to keep it for him?

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.000
Can you remember it?

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.920
Come here, come here.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.560
I need you to keep that all the time. Keep it with you all the time, okay?

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.640
Do you understand?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.080
Where’s my flash drive?

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.360
Where’s my flash drive?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.720
Deeni.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.240
Go and get his daughter.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.680
That side needs a flash drive.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.040
(Shouting)

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.720
Please let me in.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.160
Hey, I told you not to go inside.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.520
(Fighting)

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.600
(Fighting)
Let me go!

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.960
(Fighting)

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.120
Let me go!

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.000
Let me go!

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:16.960
Hey!

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.680
What’s going on?

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.880
It’s these two, sir.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.000
What is it?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.840
They are trying to come in.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.720
Who are you?

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.880
I’m asking you. Answer me.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.120
Chief Saeng.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.320
Chief Saeng.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.160
I’m a boxer.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.160
I want money.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.600
I’m a swimmer.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.400
Can we try it? Please…

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.960
Are you really a boxer?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.160
Yes, sir. I want to box.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.120
Please, Chief Saeng. Please…

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.720
Then show me how you box first.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.160
Right the way, sir.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.120
(Fighting)

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.800
(Fighting)

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.200
Alright, that’s enough.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920
Enough!

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.480
Not bad at all.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.840
Do you want to box for my gym?

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.400
Yes, sir. Thank you, Chief.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.400
Thank you, Chief.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.040
Inspector, the fish has eaten the bait.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.200
Let’s go.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:38.160
(Crowd cheering)

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.600
Why are there security cameras in here?

00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:00.360
So that I can see which boxer is good enough to fight for me in the ring.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.160
(Crowd cheering)

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.520
- How many matches today?
- Four, sir.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.120
- Let these two fight with boxers from Pong’s gym.
- Yes, sir.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.640
Hey

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.680
Go.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240
Go on. Just go in there.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.120
(Crowd cheering)

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.680
Go in.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.000
Go in.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.520
Hey, where are you going?

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.280
This is really his hideout, just like what our informant said.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.000
But how are we going to contact our team outside?

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.760
That’s not important. What we have to do now is find Michael.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.080
But we’re locked up here.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.920
Damn it!

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.560
Shit! Which way should we go?

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.000
I need to talk to your boss.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.160
I said stop talking!

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:26.880
Shit!

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.800
Say it.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.160
Hey, that’s Michael.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.800
Shit.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.120
It’s really him.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.760
Yeah. What to do now?

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.200
We have to get out of here.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.840
He’s so close.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.520
Can you get out?

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.400
Khem, try looking for a way out on that side. I’ll take care of this side.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.480
Damn it.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.600
You two can get out. It’s time to box.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.200
- Well, the thing is…
- Out.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.480
We don’t want to box now.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.320
Can we go back?

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.800
Too late now. Go!

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.960
Hang on. Give me a second.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.800
Go, go.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.520
I said go. Come here.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:52.400
(Crowd cheering)

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.680
Who’s paying?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.280
Deeni. Deeni.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.320
Deeni

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.120
It’s all right.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.520
It’s all right, Deeni.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.520
It’s just a glass shattering.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.400
Your doll is dirty. I’ll clean it for you.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.880
No, it’s okay.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.520
My dad bought it for me.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.680
He told me to take good care of it.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.480
And don’t let anyone touches it.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.720
Listen, Deeni.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.720
Phaya is going to wash it and give it back to you.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.520
It’s very dirty now.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.080
Come.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.440
Please trust me. I’ll wash it for you.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.760
Come and sit over here, Deeni. Let me clean up here first.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.320
Go fight.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.120
Fight!

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.480
(Crowd cheering)

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.960
Saeng abducted Michael because he wants a flash drive which contains data about the gambling websites.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.720
Try asking Deeni about it.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.800
When you’re at home, have you ever seen your dad kept a flash drive anywhere?

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.080
My dad bought it for me.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.200
He told me to take good care of it.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.080
And don’t let anyone touches it.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.560
Tharn.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.000
This must be the flash drive that Inspector is looking for.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.680
(Crowd cheering)

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:37.800
Deeni.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.840
Protect her.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.040
(Fighting)

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.080
(Coughing)

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.120
(Crowd cheering)

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.840
Come on. Get up.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.840
(Crowd cheering)

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.920
Yay…

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.480
Turn off the live.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.560
This is bad, Inspector.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.280
What?

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.920
He already knows that Yai is a cop.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.240
Shit.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.560
What to do?

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.000
Why are you here?

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.200
To box, sir.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.360
Is the cop salary not good enough?

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.680
Is that why you have to box?

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.720
Stop! I said stop!

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.320
Stop!

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.520
Stay still.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.360
Tell every team…

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.720
to track for a black van with plate no. อธ3417.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.280
They’ve got Deeni.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.920
Deeni. Tharn, Deeni!

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.280
What should we do?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.160
Let’s go in.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.280
I’m asking you, why are you here?

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.120
Chief Saeng.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.040
Chief.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.360
The police are coming.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960
Put your gun down.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.000
Put your gun down.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.760
Move away, if you’re not involved.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.600
Put your gun down.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.240
Oh, hello, Inspector.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.160
Do you really thing you can get out of here alive?

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.040
Inspector, Michael is here.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.640
Ah, now I know why you’re here.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.960
You better turn yourself in.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.560
Your people might be more in number here.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.040
But my men have already surrounded this place.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.720
Really?

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.840
Let me go!

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.160
Let me go!

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.120
I think you better put down your guns.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.080
Or else they are dead.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.720
Don’t do that, Inspector.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.120
No, Inspector.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.760
Put your gun down!

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.520
Put it down.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.240
Good.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.320
Good.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.400
Better send us the hostage.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.120
The police already know that you’re hiding out here.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680
You won’t get away this time.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.760
Oh, really?

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.760
Even in this situation, you still dare to negotiate with me?

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.200
Fine then.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.400
Do you want to play a game?

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.480
I like playing games.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.720
Let’s do this.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:53.040
I’m going to live broadcast these two fighting each other. They must keep fighting until I’m satisfied.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.080
I lost a lot of profit today because of you two.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.760
So, you must do something worthwhile to repay the loss.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.240
Turn on the live.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.120
What do you mean?

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.760
Shut up and start fighting.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.120
Either you…or you, will have to die here tonight.

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.680
Or else all of your friends die.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.720
So?

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.520
Do you think I was just kidding?

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.720
Thongthai. Thongthai.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.160
Thongthai. Thongthai.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.160
Let me go.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.920
Do you want to play this game?

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.800
I’m asking you nicely.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.560
Thongthai.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.040
Do you want him dead?

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.480
One.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.400
Don't, Chief Saeng.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.320
Two.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.720
So?

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.640
Let her go!

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.160
Get down.

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.680
No way!

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.680
I said let her go!

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.480
Stay still.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.760
Hurry up.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.520
Yai, I’m sorry

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.080
Khem.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.320
I’m so sorry.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.160
Khem.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.640
I’m sorry.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.120
Khem.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.280
Listen to me.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.200
Damn it!

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.400
Stop! Khem, stop!

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:37.800
Please help me!

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.840
Lucky me. I get to see police officers fighting each other today.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.200
Wow, nice move.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.920
Get up.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.640
(Gunshots)

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.200
(Gunshots)
Go!

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.400
(Gunshots)

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840
Go! Go!

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.880
Follow me!

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.640
Captain, where’s Deeni?

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.960
They took her away. I was too late.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.480
Damn it!

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.040
Yes?

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.200
What? Can’t get a hold of Inspector’s team?

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.800
Are you sure?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.160
Okay.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.120
What happened to Inspector, Captain?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.120
Our people there also don’t know…

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.120
They can’t get a hold of him and his team.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.200
I’ll leave the flash drive at the unit.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.880
I’ll let you know if there’s any update.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.280
According to the latest record before we lost connection with the Inspector team,

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.680
it says that their last location is at a deserted warehouse in Nahkon Sawan.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.600
We suspect that it’s the route used for transferring illegal items to the North.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.680
It matches with the information Captain Achara has obtained.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.360
There’s an order for both of you to bring in the forces and go raid the warehouse.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.760
Please be careful.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:01.360
They’re here? That’s fast. Your men really did a great job, Inspector Akk.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:03.960
Where are they?

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.200
If you want your friends back, you must do as I say.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.840
What do you want?

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.000
Michael’s daughter.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.240
How do I know you wouldn’t betray me?

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.280
I’ll let 3 of them go.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.000
But if you don’t do as I say,

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.760
the rest of them won’t go out of here alive.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.360
Where do you want me to meet you?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.520
At the border.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.320
How’s Michael?

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.600
Guys! Inspector! Singh!

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.000
Thongthai.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.760
Thongthai.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.000
Thongthai, Thongthai.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.080
Doc, I said I’m okay.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.320
Thongthai.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.440
Let me go! I’m going to help Khem.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.000
Thongthai, calm down.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.360
- Look at yourself.
- Let me go!

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.680
- Calm down, okay?
- Let me go!

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.120
Phaya

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.040
Calm down, okay?

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.160
You want me to calm down?

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.440
What if it were Tharn who got captured, will you be able to stay calm?

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.800
Damn it!

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.000
Inspector, Saeng has contacted back.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.240
He said both Michael and Deeni are with him.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.600
He wants us to trade the flash drive with those two.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.440
I’m going to take my team to the border and rescue the hostages.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.280
Then I’ll hand-deliver Saeng to you.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.040
No need.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.720
They are my team. I can take care of it.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.760
You and your team are injured. It would only obstruct the mission.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.840
Even if I have to die,

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.200
I will get them out of there alive.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.120
It’s not just about Michael and Deeni.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.080
We have to make sure our team can get back safely too.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.080
I’ll cooperate with you for once.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.960
I’m safe, sir.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.440
My team and the Inspector’s team are on our way to the border to rescue the hostages.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.960
I’ve already requested for a backup force.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.040
When it’s time, I’ll send them a signal.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.480
Copy that, sir.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.320
Where are my people?

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.360
And where are Michael and Deeni?

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.200
Walk.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.720
Where’s the flash drive?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.200
Let’s change our agreement a bit.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.680
What are you talking about?

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.880
All you want is the flash drive, don’t you?

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.920
So, I’ll give you your flash drive.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.200
But you have to release Michael and his daughter too.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.400
No. You can only have your men back.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.240
Let me guess, you have to deliver something to your boss after this.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.920
Without this flash drive, everything is over.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.000
Such a fair exchange, isn’t it?

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.360
I’m not going to negotiate with you.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.920
I can only release your people.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.480
Take them out.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.640
Go.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.480
I’ll count to 5. If you don’t give me the flash drive,

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.520
then you can carry their dead bodies out of here.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.200
One.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.120
Two.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.359
Three.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.240
Four.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.319
Just give me the flash drive!

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.120
Inspector.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.600
On my signal, get rid of them all.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.600
Okay.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.920
What the heck?! Why is it so big?

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.560
Titcharuj.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.680
Move! Move!

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:42.640
His boss just ran off.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.640
Come, Tew. Let’s go.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.080
Go after the hostages.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.399
I’ll take care of here.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:53.479
Yes, Captain.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:56.920
Stop.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.560
Khem, are you okay?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.240
Sure, Babe.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.200
Are you alright?

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.280
Let’s go.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.040
Hang on.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.600
Move

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:44.880
Quickly

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.640
Take Michael with you. I’ll handle here.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.560
Move, move. Quickly.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.360
Tharn, go look after Deeni.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.360
But…

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.920
Our mission comes first. Go!

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.240
Come here

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240
Hurry up!

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.560
Quickly

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.560
Stop!

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.160
This is for destroying my family.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.800
Captain

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.160
Thank you for your team’s hard-work and sacrifices.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.920
They are all so wild like you.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.920
Honey.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.320
I told you I’m safe and sound. Talk to you later, okay?

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.120
Thank you for saving my dad and my life, Mummy and Daddy

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.080
Hey…

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.160
It's time to go.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.240
Thank you, IDF.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.760
Guys.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.480
Miss Mayris shouldn’t have been the head of forensic team.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.520
With her body, she should’ve been the winner of Durian beauty pageant.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.120
Babe, my arms ache a lot. Can you feed me, please?

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.200
Can’t you eat it yourself?

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.000
So pampered.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.040
It hurts, bro.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.040
What the heck, Khem?!

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:12.480
What is it?

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.440
There.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.360
Look over there.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.600
Phaya, cheers!

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.280
Bring it on.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.800
Hey, how come you are all wet?

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.520
Thank you guys. Thank you so much.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.760
For saving me and Khem.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.760
Of course, we have to save you. We’re a team, aren’t we?

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.760
Tharn. Phaya. Thank you so much for saving us.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.160
Yeah.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.640
Being a police officer like us…

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.000
we really don’t know where life would take us to.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.320
Being a cop is about being risky.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.440
At least what we do…

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.720
can help protect the ones we love, right?

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.120
But you have to promise me one thing.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.040
No matter how risky it is, you must take good care of yourself.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.520
Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of you too.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.240
I had to go through a lot of hard times in order to have you by my side.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.440
You will be stuck with me for a long time, Tharn.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.280
Don't worry

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.120
Understood?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.200
Yeah, I got it.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:48.080
Understood?

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.000
Hey, I’m still right here. Now, I’m jealous. I wish my wife were here too.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.000
So noisy.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.960
So what?

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:06.280
Guys, Captain Achara said there’s a new case.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.280
She wants our team to go help.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.560
Can we see it, Miss Mayris?

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.240
Aah, the fun time is over.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.920
Being with you guys is always fun.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.880
Let me have a look.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.400
Here

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.120
IDF Team, are you ready?

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.840
Just bring it on!
