00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.320
I only believe in evidence.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.280
If you want me to believe in what you said...

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.320
go find me the evidence.

Dammit!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.640
Do you realise that your reckless actions will get us all into trouble?!

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.840
I will take responsibility alone for what happened last night.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.720
If you guys really want to help me, then find out who the real culprit is.

The Sign

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.800
Are you saying that the answer you’ve been looking for about your dream...

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.560
has something to do with our past lives?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.760
That you are the Garuda and I’m the Naga...

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.320
I’m that woman who often appears in your dream?

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:25.840
Yeah.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.680
Wansarut, you and I have been in love since our past lives.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.000
But the war between our kinds...

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.800
brought us to death as if we had been cursed.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.920
The shadow that has been trying to attack me all this time...

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.920
is another Naga.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.080
He tries to separate you from me so that we can’t be together.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.800
So...

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.960
that Naga shadow also exists in this life.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.080
Who is he?

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.680
Why do you want me to keep it a secret from Tharn? Why can’t I tell him about Chalothorn?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.360
If Tharn knows, he will surely do something.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.320
He will try to stop Chalothorn.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.040
And might try to settle things by himself.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.560
The 15th night of the 11th moon is coming soon.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.720
You must be careful and don’t let Chalothorn get close to Tharn.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.600
Protect him from whatever that might make him in danger.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.600
Once the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon has passed,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.360
Tharn will then be free from the karma and those whom he has done wrong in the past. Am I right?

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.440
If possible,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.040
- I want Tharn to come stay with me...
- Okay

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.640
until the Day of Judgement has passed.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.480
So, every time when an unexplainable incident occured…

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.080
in every case that both of us were working on,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520
whether those incidents at the training camp...

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.680
or the ones during Narong and Art’s cases. Did all those happen because of that man?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.280
Listen to me, Tharn.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.040
No matter what is going happen.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.320
I’ll always be by your side to protect you.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.080
The prophecy that the Abbot used to tell us when we were young…

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.560
is about to happen inevitably.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.960
You’ll be in danger because of me.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.120
Just like my parents.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.360
Hey, he can’t harm me.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.240
I have this amulet with me.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.040
Don’t you worry. I’m not going to leave you again.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.159
If we can’t avoid what’s going to happen,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.280
maybe running away is not the right answer anymore.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.480
Yeah.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.600
Since I still have to recover...

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.600
and you’re suspeneded from work,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.960
should we go see the Abbot?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.840
I can’t right now.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.520
I need to find out the truth.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.920
I need to know if Chart is related to the killer who murdered my parents.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.400
Khem is taking care of it right now.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.800
I want you to use this time during your suspension...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.360
to take some rest for a while.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.840
I’ll help you find out about your parent’s case.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.680
Let’s go see the Abbot in Nongkai together, okay?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.280
Please?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.360
Okay.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.520
Oh, there’s one more thing.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.680
Yes?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.200
If Chalothorn comes to see you or ask you to go anywhere with him,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.680
you must tell me right the way.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.440
Don’t go anywhere with him alone, okay?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.800
Why?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.640
I’m jealous. Is that reasonable enough?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.560
Don’t go anywhere with him again, okay? I’m begging you.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.840
Please, Tharn.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.400
Fine, you don’t have to worry about that though.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.680
I’m sure he’s quite fed up to quarrel with you.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.360
He didn’t even call or text me during the past few days.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.280
Did he tell you where he’d go?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.040
He didn’t tell me anything.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.280
I don’t know what he’s doing either.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.040
Is that so?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.120
Yeah.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.760
Huh? Why is it not charging?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.560
Geez, he forgot to plug it in.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.680
Now we don’t know if Yai has called about the case.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.280
(Text Message Sound)

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.520
(50 Missed Calls)

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.120
(Missed Call)

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.480
What the heck?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.720
(Missed Call)

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.160
(Where are you?)

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.440
(Where are you?)
(Answer the phone)
(Phaya’s missing.)

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.720
(Tharn)
(Tharn)
(Read messages,please)

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.280

(Phaya’s missing.)
(Tharn)

(Tharn)
(Read messages,please)
(Tharn)

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.800
Phaya, did you tell your sister and grandma...

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800
when you left the hospital last night?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.280
No.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.040
Did you call them this morning?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.120
Shit, I forgot.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.080
I didn’t bring my phone with me.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.840
Yai, Grandma, and your sister are looking for you right now.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.840
Tharn! Tharn! Open the door!

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.000
Tharn! Tharn!

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.520
Phaya has been missing since last night.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.400
His grandma and sister are looking for him.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.800
Tharn! Phaya has been missing from the hospital since last night.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.320
I still couldn’t contact him.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.920
Do you know where he is?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.360
Do you?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680
Umm, I’m here, Grandma.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.200
Please drink some water first, Grandma.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.240
You’ve just recovered.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.760
Why did you rush out of the hopsital like that? Why did you run away?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.320
Why did you run away?

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.200
Do you know your sister and I were worried sick about you?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.840
I’m really sorry, Grandma.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.480
I just...

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.080
had an urgent case to discuss with Tharn.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.640
Where did you discuss it, on the bed or sofa?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.000
You shouldn’t care about your work more than your care for your life.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.480
Didn’t you know you almost got killed from drowning?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.520
Grandma and I were so worried about you.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.080
I’m really sorry for not thinking it through.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.240
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you and Nee first.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.760
I’m really sorry.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.160
I have to apologize to Grandma and Paranee too...

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.760
for not telling you when I found out he had left the hospital last night. I should have called and let you know.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.760
Grandma, I’m sorry for making you worried.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.040
I promise I’ll be more careful from now on.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.320
I will always think twice and not act on impulse.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.360
And I will not do anything that’d make you and Nee...

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.440
worry about me again.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.320
Please rest assured, Grandma.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.600
I’ll help take care of him too.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.680
Hey.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.440
Why are you holding hands?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.680
Are you guys lovers?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.840
Really?

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.880
Since when?

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.560
Why didn’t anyone tell me that you guys are together?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.400
So fake, Yai.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.640
Grandma.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.120
I have something important to tell you.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Give me a second.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.960
Okay, go ahead.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.760
Well...

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.840
Tharn and I,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.760
we are...

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.400
we’re dating.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.520
Give me a second.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.720
So, if it weren’t because you ran out of the hospital last night...

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.720
and then I finally found you here,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.040
you’d have still kept it a secret from me, wouldn’t you?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.000
I didn’t mean to keep it a secret from you, Grandma.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.400
I just didn’t get a chance to tell you.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.880
I was afraid you might not approve of...

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.080
me dating a guy.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200
Phaya.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.000
Haven’t I told you before...

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.840
that whom you want to be with is your own choice to make?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.440
Because it’s you who’d live that life.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.040
Don’t you remember?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.040
Tharn.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.920
Thank you for always taking care of him.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.400
Since that day when he was drowned...

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.400
and recently when you had brought him back from death.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.360
If it weren’t because of you,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.480
I would have lost him long ago.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.560
Thank you, dear.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.160
Thank you for understanding me, Grandma.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.240
Please don’t worry, Grandma.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.240
It is my job to protect him.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.360
I will always be by his side.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.960
You go on and talk to them.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.680
Grandma.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.080
Yes?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.320
There’s one more thing.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.120
Oh, more?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.120
Give me a second.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040
Now you can say it.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.720
Well...

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720
during this time that I’m still recovering,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.040
Tharn has to go back to Nongkai.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.400
Can I...can I go with him too?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.080
So that we could take care of each other.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.680
Awww, you’re so crazy in love, Police Officer.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.960
Is that all?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.880
You scared me.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.880
You don’t have to ask for my permission.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.280
After that drowning incident,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.320
I still haven’t gone back to Nongkai since then.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.720
Can I go with you? I want to go see the Abbot too.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.880
Can I?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.240
Of course, Grandma.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.080
Thank you, Grandma.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.000
Inspector, we’ve found a suspect. Do you want our team to arrest him?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.880
Not yet.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.280
Tell them to keep an eye on our suspect.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.960
Hey, we must get as much infromation as possible today.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.040
Singh

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.840
Can you hack into the police bureau database?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.760
I want to know what Chart has been doing since he left the training camp.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.240
You got it. I’ll take care of that.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.640
And for me...

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.680
I’ll go check out the Inspector’s desk.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.200
He might hide something in there.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.760
Let’s go.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.560
(Excited Sound)

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.720
Geez, too many people here. What to do now?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.080
I have a plan.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.360
Hey, listen up!

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.960
There’s a meat ball vending stall in front of our building.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.800
It’s Thongthai’s treat.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.120
Don’t you want to grab some?

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.240
Hurry up or it’ll be sold out soon.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.960
Enjoy eating.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.520
You’re really something.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.120
I told you.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.120
Bingo!

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.760
Baby, are you done?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200
Bingo!

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.440
Hey.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.360
Where are you guys going?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.800
To Tharn’s place.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.960
He forgot something at the office. I’ll drop by and give it to him.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.720
Um

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.800
- Let’s go. / - Let’s go.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.400
Singh has looked into Chart’s record.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.880
After he failed the test, he didn’t go back to work with his unit.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.440
But what’s strange is, he still hasn’t filed for a resignation as a police officer.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.280
His work record has also been wiped out completely.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.640
I tried to get some information from his police colleagues,
but no one knows his whereabout.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.560
It’s quite similar to what happened to Lieut Tam.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.800
And to Inspector’s older brother too.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.520
Their record as a police officer were wiped out clean.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.760
As for me,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.880
I’ve checked the CCTV cameras at the club.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.800
Everything was also deleted.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.840
This is really strange.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.880
It’s as if someone is cleaning up after Chart’s mess so that there’ll be no traces of him.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.320
Khem and I sneaked in to search the Inspector’s desk.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.720
We found a file containing a prisnor’s record.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.800
It’s a record of Khom, Montree’s right-hand man.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.360
Look at his right wrist.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.600
The spider tattoo.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.240
They are the same.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.880
So, I looked into Khom’s record.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.880
While he was still in jail, the one who bailed him out was Montree.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.760
I also looked into old cases.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.400
Turns out every Montree’s lackey who used to be in jail has this spider tattoo.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.640
Tharn said he saw a spider tattoo on Chart’s wrist.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.880
Does this mean Chart is also one of Montree’s lackeys?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.960
Tharn.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.720
Maybe what you told me…

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.480
about your parents’ case and also Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.480
is Montree the one behind all these?

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.400
Inspector already knew.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.160
Why didn’t he tell us then?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.320
Why trying to keep it a secret from us?

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.040
Oh!

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.280
Maybe, Inspector is also one of Montree’s people...

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.280
who helps taking care of things inside the unit.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.440
Well, it was just an idea.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.120
The most dangerous person is the one closest to us.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.040
Like a plot from ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.040
Or ‘GAP The Series’.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.520
You see? Such a plot twist, isn’t it?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.960
Hey, where are you going?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.000
I’m going to see the Inspector.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.000
No, you’re not.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.000
You’ll only upset him and make things worse.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.920
What if you get suspensed longer?

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.920
I’m not going to argue with him.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.000
I’ll just want to ask him about my father.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.760
I promise I’ll behave.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.200
See? I told you.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.200
Like a scene in ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.960
And ‘GAP The Series’.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.520
Exactly the same.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.760
You’re still suspended. Why are you here?

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.200
I need to ask you about something, Inspector.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.800
Do you know my father?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:09.280
My father used to tell me that he planned to adopt a younger brother of his junior officer who died in line of duty as his son.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.640
But that boy turned down the offer.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.160
So, my father could only support him for his education.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.040
The boy I’m talking about is you, isn’t it?

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.600
Yes, it is.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.400
Then why didn’t you tell me you know my father?

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.000
Or is it because you’re still mad at my father for taking care of your brother’s case?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.720
Your brother, Captain Itt, commited a breach of discipline.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.040
He bribed Montree.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.480
And chose to kill himself instead of serving his punishment.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.960
My brother was innocent.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.280
So was my father.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.520
He was also innocent.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.880
And I, too, believe that your brother was also innocent.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.840
My father used to tell me that your brother was a good cop -- a very honest man.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.560
If I have a chance again, I want to be a good cop like your brother, Inspector.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.280
But why do you have to keep it a secret from me?
Why keeping information about the case and Montree to yourself?

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.320
Everything that I know up to now is nothing but the truth.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.840
You want to know the truth about your brother’s case.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.440
I also want to know the truth about my father’s case.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.680
I don’t trust anyone in this unit. I can’t trust anyone.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.040
On the day your father died, he got a hand on the evidence
about where Montree and his gang smuggled in drugs

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.680
But while he was on the way back to the unit, an accident occured.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.280
I didn’t believe it was a coincidence.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.600
So, I kept digging into this case.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.480
Until I found out that your father was betrayed by someone in his unit.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.280
Do you know who that person is?

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.440
Your father’s team leader.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.800
That’s why I have to do it secretly.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.840
The investigation must be done surreptitiously.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.640
That’s why I couldn’t tell anyone about it.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.840
You asked me why I didn’t tell you that I know your father.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.920
It’s because I’m sure...

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.400
that if someone or anyone in our unit has found out about this,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.440
you will be in danger.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.840
Is there anything else that you want to know?

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.120
Tharn, maybe you should go back first.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.680
Go and get yourself together.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.680
About the case and everything that happened,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.360
I’ll tell you everything that you want to know once you’re back to work.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320
Yes, Inspector.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.560
How are you doing?

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.240
I’m doing well, Luangpor.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.080
I hope you’re feeling well too.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.480
I am. How long are you going to stay this time?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.400
Where are you staying?

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.000
We’ll stay here for a week.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.800
We’re staying at Tharn’s grandmother’s place.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.040
Phaya told me that it’s very cozy and beautiful there.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:10.960
Yes, the view around there is very scenic. It’s close to the forest and waterfall too.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.560
It’s good that you go and stay with your grandmother so that you can also take care of her.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.480
She’s very worried about you.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.960
You never call and let her know how you are.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.720
Tharn, can you take me to the waterfall after this?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.560
Don’t trouble him any further.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.560
We are already staying at his place.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.000
It’s all right, Grandma.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.680
I’ll be her personal tour guide and take her around.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.720
Phaya and Tharn, come and give me a hand.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.480
I want to give all of you the holy threads to help protect you from the danger. Let’s go.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.320
Yes, Luangpor.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.240
Here are the holy threads.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.200
Make sure all of you wear it.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.680
Thank you

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.160
How are you feeling now? Have you fully recovered?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.560
I feel much better now, thank you.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.080
Luangpor.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.040
Do you know where Chalothorn is?

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.680
He seems to disappeared after the incident.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.440
He didn’t call or come to see Tharn at all.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.800
I couldn’t come into contact with his spirit in my meditation either.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.680
He’s probably severely hurt.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.240
You must stay close to Tharn and take a good care of him.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.520
The Naga Fireball Festival is near.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.840
Chalothorn will regain his power and become even more powerful.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.520
one day before the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.520
Maybe, both of you should come stay with me...

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.440
- Okay, I’ll let Tharn know about his.
- Good.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.960
Hurry up and go home before it’ll get dark.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.080
Tharn.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.600
We’d get going then, Luangpor.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.960
Good luck to you all.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.840
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello, dear.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.360
- Do you want to hug?
- Give me a hug first.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.880
Hmmmm

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.720
Look who are here with me.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.360
Oh, hello there.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.600
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness! Long time no see.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.000
- How are you doing?
- I’m good, thank you.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.400
Welcome, all of you.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.320
Let’s get inside. It’s quite hot right here.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.640
Please come in.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.080
Let’s go.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.120
The Bael juice. I made it myself.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.520
- How is it?
- It’s very tasty. Makes me feel fresh.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.320
- If you like it, I’ll make it for you every day.
- Oh, please don’t bother.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.520
Our grandmas are quite the same.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.720
If you compliment on her food or tell her that you like to eat anything, she’d cook it for you every day.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.960
Recently, I had to eat a green curry for a whole week!

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.480
I’ve been having Egg and Pork in Sweet Brown Sauce for two weeks.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.440
My face is getting so round.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.680
Let’s go.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.040
Tharn told me that you own a wood processing plant.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.440
That’s right.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.360
It belongs to our family. Our main products are wooden furnitures.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.160
These tables and cabinets are all my design.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.800
Wow.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.920
Really?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.040
- Of course.
- You’re so talented.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.200
Grandma, do you know that she was also very adventurous when she was younger?

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.840
She even went into the wood to supervise the workers herself.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.199
I didn’t have any choice.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.760
My son wanted to become a police officer.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.120
And my only grandson, whom I hoped would take care of our business,
also decided to walk in his father’s footsteps.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.080
Oh, Phaya is like that too.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.040
He didn’t want to help me take care of the family business.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.960
He just wants to become a cop. Now, he’s finally one.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.080
This one is really something too.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.360
He secretly sneaked out and applied for the exam. He didn’t tell me anything.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.440
Quite a handful he is. I wonder if I’ve been raising up a boy or a monkey.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.320
That’s what I’m thinking too.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:51.480
Phaya is quite the same. He’s so stubborn. He never listens to anyone.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.000
- I’m afraid both of your grandsons are surely monkeys.
- Yes, indeed.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.640
(Laughing)

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.920
Seems like your grandma and mine can get along really well.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.440
Did I make the right choice introducing them to each other?

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.560
Miss, the food is now ready.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.840
Oh, okay then. Let’s eat, shall we?

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.320
The food is fresh from the oven.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.800
Then you can take a shower later.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.160
- Oh, that’s right. Phaya.
- Yes?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.040
I’m afraid you have to sleep in Tharn’s room tonight.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.400
Do you mind?

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.960
Not at all.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.600
Okay

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.560
I’ll go and tidy up the room for you.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.400
Then make it quick. Hurry up and come down for your meal, okay?

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.360
Yes, Grandma.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.040
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:21.840
While we were still at the camp, you told me you’ve lived with the Abbot since when you were a kid.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.400
The Abbot is someone that my family respects.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.760
Since my parents passed away,

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:39.560
the Abbot told my grandma that I am bound to make my loved ones die.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.080
So, he asked my grandma to let me stay with him at the temple.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.520
I didn’t have anyone then...

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.480
apart from my grandma.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.640
So, I decided to take the offer and lived with the Abbot ever since.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.240
My grandma often came to visit me.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:10.080
Do you have to stay with him for the rest of your life?

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.400
I don’t know.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.280
I want to move back to live with my grandma.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.480
I plan to do that after I’m done with my father’s case.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.440
I’m going to quit my job and stay with her.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.880
I want to look after her, to show her my gratitude for raising me up.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.320
At least you got to stay with your parents for a while.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.520
And shared wonderful memories with them.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.480
Honestly, I don’t remember much about my father.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.360
Growing up, I only saw him dedicated himself in work as a police officer.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:09.520
Until his last breath, he died because he was a cop.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.840
They’re probably looking at you from above.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.240
I hope so too.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.320
I want my parents to see...

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.600
when I can finally put the person who killed them behind bars.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.720
Sir,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.360
please don’t worry about Tharn.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.800
I’m going to take care of him for you.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.880
I’m going to arrest the killer who took your life.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.760
Thank you.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.560
Let’s go put your things in the room.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.840
Okay.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.800
Hello, Yai.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.680
I have good news.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.680
Ning agrees to be our witness.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.200
Really?

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.560
She told us she found a flash drive that Kao kept as an evidence.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.680
Inspector and our team are on their way to see Ning at her place.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.520
Call me as soon as you get anything new, okay?

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.680
Okay. Are you at your grandma’s place?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.320
Yeah.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.760
Please take care, okay?

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.880
Okay. Say hi to the Abbot for me.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.680
And tell him I’ll go visit him after the case is done.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840
I have to go.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.080
Okay.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.560
I hope the evidence we get from Ning will be solid enough to arrest Montree.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.920
Hey, any update from Yai?

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.840
No.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.160
Don’t worry, he will call you if there’s anything important.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.520
Ouch.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.520
(Strangling / Gasping for breath)

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.040
Tharn! What’s wrong?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.480
Did you have a vision?

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.600
Yes, Korn is going to kill Ning.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.960
(Incoming call)

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.520
Hello, Tharn.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.760
Hello, Yai.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.360
I saw a vision where Khom was going to kill Ning.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.680
What? Khom is going to kill Ning?

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.400
(Crying)

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.160
How did he know Khom is going to kill Ning?

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.760
I’ll explain it to you later, Inspector.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.880
But he’s never been wrong with his information.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.840
How do you know Khom is going to kill Ning?

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.160
Please trust me, Inspector.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.640
Don’t question me anything right now.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.760
Hurry up and go to Ning’s place first. I’m begging you.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.920
You can go now. I’ll take if from now on.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.480
(Commotion outside the house)

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.720
All clear.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.120
Okay.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.520
Just run a red light, Khem.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.240
Yes, sir.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.560
Ouch!

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.280
(Screaming in fright)

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.840
Who are you?

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.560
Why are you here? Get out!

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.120
(Screaming)

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.520
(Screaming in pain)

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.760
That’s Ning’s house. Hurry up.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.480
Okay.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.120
I’m sorry, Inspector.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240
You can’t go in there.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.040
Please stop.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.080
You can’t go in there.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:47.760
You can’t go in there.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.840
Hold on.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.480
Ning

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.000
Inspector.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.040
She’s dead.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.080
Commander, the witness is dead.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.520
What should we do?

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.760
If we don’t do something, they will have this case closed soon.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.560
Montree is definitely behind this.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.600
Go find the evidence that Ning wanted to give to us.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.080
- Go! / - Yes, sir.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.120
Ouch!

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.800
Who are you?

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.800
Why are you here? Get out!

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.720
Yes.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.640
Yes.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.560
Yes, sir.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.960
You and your men should leave, Inspector.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.120
This case is no longer your responsibility.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:34.840
What?

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.840
What do you mean?

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.320
You and your team are removed from this case.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.520
- What do you mean?
- You can’t do that!

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.360
We’ve been on this case since the very beginning.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.440
- The victim is also our prime witness.
- That’s enough!

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.200
Follow your order.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.200
Yes, sir.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.720
Let’s go.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.440
What did you say?

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.880
Ning is dead?

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.360
Dammit!

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.600
She did leave us any evidence.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.080
But we still couldn’t help her!

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.160
How many times do I have to face something like this?!

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.760
Tharn, please calm down.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.200
The one who should feel sorry is Montree, not you.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.520
Once you get back to work, you can help make her soul rest in peace...

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.600
by arresting the one who killed her.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.320
M’Lady!

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.440
M’Lady!

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.280
M’Lady! We’ve got a problem!

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.280
What’s going on, Tong?

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.600
Our workers who’ve gone into the woods to collect wild products.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.680
They were eaten by the tiger-man.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.000
A tiger-man?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.880
That’s right.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:54.920
Careful!

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.400
What happened, Kham?

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.520
Joe and Kai went across the border into the woods in Laos to collect wild products

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.240
Kai got eaten by the tiger-man.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:02.840
What?!

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.200
A tiger-man is not real.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.240
What would you know?

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.880
It is real.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.880
If you don’t believe it, then don’t distrepect it.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.320
I’m not disrespecting it.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.680
Where’s the body of that worker?

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.400
Joe said it was aleady taken by the tiger-man.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.520
It took the body and ate it up.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.080
The, the, the...the tiger-man took Kai’s body away.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.880
Singh, play it.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.120
Yes, sir.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.240
Gather as many artworks as you can.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.120
This time is going to be a big lot.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.160
Okay.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.400
But I will have to increase the price this time.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.400
Can you help talk to the Minister for me, Khom?

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.160
You’ll see him tomorrow anyway.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.000
Tell him yourself then.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.120
Once you get all the artworks, send them to the warehouse in Nongkai.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.960
Nongkai?

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.000
(Incoming message)

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.880
[Montree is heading to NongKai, where the NongKai forest produces medicine along the Mekong River.]

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.760
Montree.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.480
You won’t get away this time.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.040
idolfactory

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.920
I want to know why Tharn knew Ning was going to be killed.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.480
I want someone who knows the route that Joe and Kai took.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.960
They don’t believe that Kai was eaten by a tiger-man.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.400
Why did you call Chalothorn?

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.280
Phaya.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.440
This is my family’s matter, let me handle it.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.680
Am I not the one you love?

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.080
What did he do to you? Why do you hate him so much?

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.520
Because he’s the Naga!

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.440
(Gunshot)

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.080
Hey!

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.760
(Gunshot)

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.120
Watch out!

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.280
Shit!

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:41.400
