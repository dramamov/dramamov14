00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.080
How long has she been sleeping?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.810
Captain Luo,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.360
just for a little while.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
What did the doctor say?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.080
Nothing serious,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.610
just needs time to recover.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.640
Officer,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.760
his hand is swollen.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.560
Can I use the other hand instead?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.640
Zhu Chongliang.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.280
Stay back!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400
Come any closer and I'll kill her!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.120
Zhu Chongliang.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.720
Calm down.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.920
We know you didn't kill anyone,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.039
and we're not here to arrest you.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.920
You're lying!

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.330
I've killed people.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.520
I killed everyone who hurt Lu Ningzhi.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.320
Are you going to hurt her too?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.759
The person you're holding hostage

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.120
never hurt Lu Ningzhi.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.210
Take me instead.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.759
I'll be your hostage.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.039
Come on.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.560
Stay back!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.920
I said stay back!

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.170
Zhu Chongliang,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.200
did Tao Han use a syringe

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.160
to stab people that night too?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.720
Come here

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
Behave yourself.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400
Think carefully.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.440
That night, how did Tao Han

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.720
get into room 601?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.490
Did he knock or enter the passcode?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.280
Also,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200
when did Dong Chengbin allegedly harass

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.000
Lu Ningzhi, as you claimed?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Was it right then?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.520
Bite me.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.280
You dare bite me?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Help!

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.080
Help me!

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.760
Help! Is anyone there?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.840
Run!

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.120
Run!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.600
Get away!

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.560
Where are you running to?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.120
Come here.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.560
Help! Is anybody there?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.360
Run!

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.440
Let me go!

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.000
Run!

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520
Help me!

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.520
Help! Is anyone there?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.980
I'll show you for running.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.120
Run now!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520
You... help me!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.480
Please save me!

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.400
I...

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:46.880
Run!

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.560
Answer me.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.800
What did you see?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.200
I... I saw...

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.400
She was bullied.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.240
The man she liked

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.840
and who liked her back.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.760
He avenged her.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.519
It's all because I was too cowardly.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.399
That person,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.560
he truly was braver than me.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.360
Sir.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.560
Why is this camera pointing at the wall?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.880
It can't record anything like this.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.520
Exactly.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.980
It used to face the window.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
When was it moved?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.000
Sir.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.140
Please have a seat.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.960
Could you help me check something?

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.720
This one here.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.200
The footage from this camera.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.800
Could you pull it up?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Let's take a look together.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.260
Starting from yesterday.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.920
Isn't this from three days ago?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.680
Three days ago in the morning.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.760
This camera was facing the side window on the first floor.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.690
So it must have been moved that day.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.480
Sir.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.000
Sorry to trouble you again.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.080
Could you pull up

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.080
the duty roster from three days ago?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.480
Thank you for your help.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.810
The duty roster, right?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.080
Wait a moment.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.360
25.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.560
Is it 25?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.080
Let me check.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.800
Sir.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.440
Sir.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.900
Please continue looking.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.490
The duty roster.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.360
Found it.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.760
This is the duty roster from three days ago.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.400
Pan Haili was on duty.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.680
Pan Haili.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.520
Pan Haili again.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.680
Alright.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.760
I understand the situation with the case now.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.720
Let's find out where Pan Haili is.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.200
I need to confirm

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.280
if Chi Xiao is going

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800
to continue using fire

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.500
to stimulate Chi Xia's memory recovery.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.400
No one.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.360
Nobody.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.400
What about the numbers?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.840
25

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.970
and 12 are both here.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.960
What about 14?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.560
The book titled '12' that Pan Haili left behind

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.080
is actually about decoding.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.360
But what does this fox want us to decode?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.160
Heizi.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.010
Go to Dongzhou and find someone for me.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.240
Pan Haili.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.960
It's raining today.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.520
I didn't drive.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.850
Can I get a ride with you?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.120
What's wrong?

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.920
You seem off.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.080
It's that feeling again when the suspect is right in front of me,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.680
but I can't get the evidence.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.920
This is

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.760
the phone my sister used to send me messages

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.400
when she was on that mission.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.560
Luo Xun

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.640
About that stabbing serial killer case,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.800
I might have a lead.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.600
But I need to confirm something.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.720
Contact me when you see this message.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.520
I need you.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.500
Actually that day,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.970
I went to the mountains.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.840
Later,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.730
I asked the carrier,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.360
they told me there was simply no signal.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.160
So I didn't receive the message,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.520
and couldn't save my sister.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.560
As her family,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.770
they returned this phone to me afterward.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080
I've kept it with me all these years.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.280
I keep thinking,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.180
she trusted me so much,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.760
but I let her down.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.930
She needed me so desperately then,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.960
but I only realized it after she died.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.690
It's not your fault.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.680
The person who hurt my sister

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.400
is named Zheng Yanbo.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.520
He is my mentor's

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.480
son, isn't he?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.940
Luo Xun!

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.000
Luo Xun, what are you doing?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.930
Get out of my way!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.280
You've been hiding evidence

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280
and stalling for so long

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.440
just to protect him.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.800
Answer me!

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.120
You're a police officer.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.240
You're breaking the law knowingly.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.120
If I hadn't figured it out,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.460
were you planning to let this case go cold

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.770
and hide it forever?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.690
Yanbo, he...

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.600
He was just being used by others.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
He fell in with the wrong crowd.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320
That's bullshit!

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.040
Loyalty to the Party,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.360
fairness in law enforcement -

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.820
that's what you taught me.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.560
Do you know what Zheng Yanbo told me?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.000
He said he couldn't stand seeing those girls in nice clothes.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.460
He wanted to destroy them.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.800
This is what

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.160
a police officer's well-raised son turned out to be.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.640
Luo Xun!

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.540
What are you doing?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.600
You're a police officer!

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.370
But actually, he wasn't wrong.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.960
Zheng Yanbo later told me

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.060
He was provoked by someone

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.440
which triggered the evil side of his human nature.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.480
He grew up with my sister.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.840
I think my sister must have noticed something unusual

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.100
and wanted to warn him.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.800
But then...

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.620
Always having that thread of worry for family members.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.080
That constant tension, always on edge.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.680
I understand it all too well.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.680
But we're not just Luo Xun and Chi Xia.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.360
Behind us

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.420
are thousands of Dongzhou citizens.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.020
They need our protection.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.730
This is our responsibility

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.000
and our mission.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.080
I believe

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.800
you understand this without me having to explain.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.480
So stop blaming yourself.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.480
Your sister wouldn't blame you.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.290
And don't have regrets.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.480
Because regret

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.920
is the most useless thing in this world.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.880
You're the captain.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.920
I'm the captain.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.900
Why do you sound so much like the chief today?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.820
I'm learning from you.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.440
But you're right.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000
I really can't

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.920
let personal feelings cloud my judgment anymore.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.980
Dongzhou has thousands of citizens,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.460
and they all have their own families.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.760
These incitement to murder cases keep happening one after another,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.560
and people are living in fear.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.880
We need to catch them.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.600
So

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.040
our top priority

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.640
is to catch the big fish behind all this.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.720
We need to be fully prepared.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.400
- Good.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.760
- Let's go.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.360
Let's go catch the fish tonight.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.440
Not tonight.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.840
We'll do it tomorrow.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.300
Let me take you home first.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.320
Let's go.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.450
Captain Luo.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.120
Curly.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.280
Pass out the materials first.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:15.840
Okay.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.370
Captain Luo.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.280
Jue.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.000
Go ahead.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.280
I've retrieved the traffic accident case file.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.560
Everyone, please take a look.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.840
The deceased is Xu Changting.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.960
He was 52 years old

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.760
and died instantly after being hit.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.020
The driver responsible was Tao Cong'an,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.410
who is Tao Han's father.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.650
Tao Han was also in the car at that time.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.080
According to the autopsy report and records,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.960
the victim had been drinking that night.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.400
He was walking on the reservoir bridge.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.240
When Tao Cong'an was driving,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.080
he was distracted

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.040
and didn't notice the pedestrian in the middle of the road,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.500
which led to the accident.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.040
At that time, the bridge

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.600
had no surveillance cameras installed.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.400
However,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.680
the victim's family member,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.960
namely Lu Ningzhi,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.480
was also at the scene

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.680
and witnessed the entire incident.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.920
She had no objection to the driver's statement,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.560
so the case was quickly settled.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.360
I've also looked into

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.080
the verdict of this accident

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.360
and its aftermath.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.200
The Tao family paid 650,000 yuan in compensation to the Lu family.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.720
After that,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.200
Tao Han's father, Tao Cong'an,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.720
was sentenced to one and a half years in prison

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.480
for the crime of causing a traffic accident.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.360
And Tao Han, who was in college at that time,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.760
was also affected by this incident,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.640
so he

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.120
dropped out of school.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.240
Then he paid his own way

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.170
to study abroad.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.600
He just returned to the country half a month ago.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.280
What I currently know is...

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.080
Wait a moment.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.540
There's something suspicious here.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.650
Look at this.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.900
This accident scene investigation report.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.600
According to the brake mark analysis,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
at the time of the incident,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.440
the speed of the car was between

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.080
70 and 80 miles per hour.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.720
And there was emergency braking.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.650
Now look at this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.360
This is Tao Han's father,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.720
Tao Cong'an's prison physical examination report.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.920
Height: 1.72 meters.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.560
Weight: nearly 200 jin.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.210
This is clearly an obese body type.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.900
It doesn't make sense.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.200
What doesn't make sense?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
Taohan's father claims

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.000
that he was

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.080
driving

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.360
with his seatbelt fastened.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.480
But with his extremely obese body,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.080
during such a rapid emergency brake,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.480
his abdomen...

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.920
But there are no marks

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.450
of soft tissue contusions from the seatbelt.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560
Is that possible?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.680
You mean

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.880
the killer is Tao Han,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.160
not his father?

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.040
Yes.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.560
Curly.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.760
Check if there are any medical records

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.920
for Tao Han on the night of the incident

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.840
and the following days.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.720
Sure.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.680
Hello, comrade.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.940
I'm here for the night shift medication.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.760
I'm sorry.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.210
It's time for Tu Guolin's medication.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.840
Stop!

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.760
Don't run!

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.040
Catch him!

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.880
Don't move!

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.410
Let me go!

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.560
Let me go!

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.280
They're Chi Xiao's people.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.280
Our people pretended to be Good Samaritans

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.540
and gave a little help.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.200
That fake fox

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.400
won't last much longer.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:05.839
Police.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.720
Come with us.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.130
I don't like surprises.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.000
I'd rather Officer Chi bring me

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.800
fairness and justice.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.849
I wanted to kill him myself.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.640
Nobody made me do it.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.450
Do you like psychology?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.180
Manipulating people's minds

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.460
can be quite interesting sometimes.
