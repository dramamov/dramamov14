WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.800
Everyone,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
get ready for the arrest operation.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.640
Support Team Luo!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.440
Move it!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.360
Qu Bai,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.440
take your men

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.960
and make sure to capture Chi Xia.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
We'll meet at the evacuation point.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.900
The rest of you,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.520
hold back the approaching police.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.400
Yes, sir.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.080
Mountain road interception team

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.920
move out now.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.280
Forest team

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.289
tighten the perimeter.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.920
Senior,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.720
take over for me

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.360
as temporary commander.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.700
Not a single one

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.330
None of them can escape.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.900
Take cover!

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.240
Move in!

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.300
Covering fire!

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.520
It's already dark now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Old K has hidden in the dense forest.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.520
His men will cover for him.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.079
It's very difficult to capture him in the forest.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.200
If something goes wrong,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600
and he goes into hiding,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.980
or if he comes up with another plan...

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.840
Every time you make that face,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.240
it means you have an idea.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.720
Let's hear it.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.480
Right now, I'm the only one

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.740
who knows the formula.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.400
So Old K won't rest

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.600
until he captures me.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.200
And before I reveal the formula,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.440
he won't dare kill me.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.730
That being the case,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140
I might as well be the bait.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.720
[POL Curly Cao Bin]

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.480
You two get out of there now.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.040
Hurry up!

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.880
Go to the forest to support Chi Xia immediately.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.520
Be careful.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.240
Roger that.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800
Cover me!

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.400
I would never risk your life,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.400
but I need your cooperation.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.520
When we meet Old K,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.320
I need you to pretend to stop me,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.440
then secretly let me go.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.560
I'll lead Old K into our trap.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.720
Huang Rui.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.800
It seems

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.130
you haven't let me down.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.880
Qu Bai.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.520
Well done.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.090
You've certainly left yourself plenty of backup plans.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.920
Chi Xia,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.160
when it comes to turning people,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.060
you're not clever enough.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.360
Go!

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.000
Hurry!

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.360
Move!

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360
Police! Freeze!

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.660
Drop your weapons!

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.060
Don't move!

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.250
Put the gun down!

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.160
Drop it!

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.160
Hands up!

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.810
Get down!

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.360
Team Four,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.960
follow me.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.920
Yes, sir.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.220
Don't move!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.280
Stay down!

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.800
Your so-called perfect trap

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.920
is nothing but

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.600
full of holes.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.040
Let's go.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.960
Back to Lawa Village,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.480
I have ten thousand ways

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840
to make you talk.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.690
Nobody move!

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.980
Drop your weapons!

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.320
Everyone freeze!

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.040
Get down! Police!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.840
Drop the gun!

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.360
Drop your weapons!

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.440
Hands up!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.240
Put it down!

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.360
Drop it!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.800
Get down!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.600
The gun might go off.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.260
No one will collect your body.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.000
Brother Jue.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.360
It seems

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.560
I truly underestimated you.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.200
The show is finally over.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.520
No one is interested in playing along anymore.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.409
It's time to wrap things up.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.120
Take him away.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.159
Take him away.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.960
Go.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.500
Captain Luo, give me a chance.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.040
You'll spend the rest of your life with regret,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.840
doubt,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.560
and remorse.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.640
Step by step, you'll walk toward your own execution ground.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.240
Those who died because of you

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.440
will haunt you day and night,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.680
whispering in your ear over and over,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.640
asking why you did it.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.400
Young Master!

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.400
Hang in there!

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.280
Qubai,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.970
don't speak.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.409
Save your strength.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.400
Don't worry.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.640
I promise I'll take good care of Chi Xia.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.480
Young Master!

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:39.820
Doctor!

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.809
Please, I beg you, save him!

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.240
Doctor!

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.840
Young Master!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.120
Young Master!

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.760
Young Master!

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.480
Move forward.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.760
Don't look back.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.080
Little fox.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.880
You must survive.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.600
I have a sister.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.040
Whenever she won a fight,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.360
she'd get some persimmons.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.690
But she never ate them herself.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.840
She always saved them for me.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.570
What a coincidence.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.250
I used to get into fights when I was little.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.810
Whenever I got hurt,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.760
my brother would give me a lychee candy.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280
He told me

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.050
to eat some candy

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.540
and the wound wouldn't hurt anymore.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.800
Please save

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.520
my brother.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.360
You're awake.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Is everyone okay?

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360
Everyone's fine.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.880
Take it easy.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.400
How's your wound?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.760
I'm fine.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.280
How is Qubai?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.320
No.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.450
I'll go check on him.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.720
Chi Xia.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.280
The doctor said

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.650
you need to rest.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.960
I just want to see him.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.680
Which room is he in?

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.480
Listen to me.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.080
Chi Xia.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.880
What?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.160
Chi Xia.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.840
Listen to me.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.760
Chi Xia.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.120
Let me go!

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.840
Calm down.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.200
Please calm down.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.480
Let me go, Luo Xun.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.800
I just want to see him.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.400
Calm down.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.160
I just need to see him once.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Please calm down.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.320
Luo Xun, I'm begging you.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.720
Let me see him just once.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.840
He's my only family left in this world.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.600
Let me see him.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.120
Listen to me.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.680
Just one look.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.200
Listen.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.840
Qu Bai.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.520
You...

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.720
Qu Bai.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.600
Qu Bai is dead.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.920
Chi Xia.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.840
Chi Xia.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.840
Chi Xia.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.160
Are you okay?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.920
From now on,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.960
I'm all alone.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.040
Chi Xia.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.920
Chi Xia!

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.520
Chi Xia!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.760
Doctor!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.680
Someone help!

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.440
Chi Xia!

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.880
Help! Quickly!

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.080
Doctor!

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.000
Chi Xia

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.320
Chi Xia

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.400
Why did you name me Chi Xia that year?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.600
Because

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.040
summer came particularly late that year.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.000
Chi Xia.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.080
I like this name.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.400
Summer has come just as late this year.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.280
I wish you were still here.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.700
I've always been here.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.980
There are countless paths in this world,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.140
but I've always wanted to take the one leading home.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.200
Little fox.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.320
I hope on this thorny path,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.320
you can cut through the brambles

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.920
and clear a way for all those who have no choice.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.760
Including yourself.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.840
Jinzi.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.840
I've come to see you.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.580
It's my fault I couldn't find him sooner.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.690
It's not your fault.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.200
Don't cry.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.040
Salute.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.640
Recently,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.320
our city police have cracked a major case

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.960
involving the Lawazhai overseas criminal organization led by Huang Weisheng.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.080
They are charged with human trafficking,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.120
running illegal gambling operations,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.280
solicitation of murder,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.040
smuggling,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.520
illegal possession of drugs and other crimes.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.450
Now let's see the detailed report.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.120
Do you think they'll film us?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.250
They probably will.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.280
Chief Chang.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.480
Solving this case

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.240
wouldn't have been possible without everyone's hard work.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.770
You've all done a great job.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.960
Chief Chang,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.680
no need to be so formal right now,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.360
right?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.160
You're right.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280
Let's do something tangible.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.800
Not just verbal praise.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.200
Something more substantial.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.760
Well,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.120
dinner's on me tonight.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.840
What would you like to eat?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.800
Order whatever you want.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.280
Great!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.960
Where are Luo Xun and Chi Xia?

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.480
They said they're going to some secret place,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.200
I think.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.480
Lin Wenjue,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840
I've noticed that after hanging out with them for so long,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.300
you're starting to become less serious too.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.960
Alright,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.600
after work,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.440
see you at the restaurant.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.920
Sure thing!

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.200
Take care, Chief Chang.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.930
Chief Chang!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.120
Spicy hot pot, okay?

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.040
Got it.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.360
Come on, let's continue.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.800
Last time I came here with you

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.200
it felt quite magical.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200
This place makes one feel peaceful.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.480
Look at this lake.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.840
It's just like our lives.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.840
Sometimes calm.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.040
Sometimes turbulent.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.820
But no matter what difficulties we face,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.240
we always find

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.780
the strength to move forward.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.960
Yes.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.680
I once felt lost

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.640
because of my lost memories.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.240
You all gave me a second life,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.920
gave me a family again,

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.920
and helped me understand

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.380
what true teamwork means.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.800
Officer Chi,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.610
we're family, let's be straightforward.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.000
Here's to our

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.440
revolutionary friendship,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.060
may it be unbreakable.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.280
Unbreakable.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.090
To a pleasant cooperation.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.450
Let's keep up the good work.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.320
Throughout our lives,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.080
through scorching sun and bitter cold,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080
we will stay true to our hearts

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.800
and loyal to our country.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.760
Loyal to our people.

we protect

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.160
