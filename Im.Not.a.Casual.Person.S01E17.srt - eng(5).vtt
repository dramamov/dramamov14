WEBVTT

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.940
Someone has definitely been in here.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.840
Why don't you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.960
go wash up first?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.440
It's fine.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.130
I'll wash up after I'm done.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.920
I think you should wash up first.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.690
Alright.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.800
Forget it.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.320
Better not tell her.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.520
Why isn't he coming over?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.920
Maybe she should change rooms tonight.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:46.560
No.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
She'll definitely get suspicious.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.680
She's living here alone.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.940
I'm worried about her.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.329
Looks like I'll have to stay here tonight.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.840
Why isn't he saying anything?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.440
It's awkward when he's quiet at a time like this.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.600
Hey.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.320
The director said

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.920
it's time for you to go to bed.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.400
Then I'll go to sleep now.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.159
Um...

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.760
At 7 a.m.,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.640
why were you coming out of this room?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.970
What were you two doing?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.500
None of your business.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.480
I'm a very open-minded person.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.000
I won't have any dirty thoughts.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.360
Even though you two are boss and employee,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.960
but you were coming out of her room.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.360
Right?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.840
Look, if you need something, you can tell me.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840
I can pass the message to her.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.120
Or you could just call her, right?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.250
Technology is so advanced these days.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.840
Hey.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.240
What did they do?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.640
A single man and woman alone together

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680
and it's Christmas Eve.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.480
How is this possible?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.360
Either there's no chemistry

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.240
or no charm.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.760
Nonsense. How could that be?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.360
Don't believe me? See for yourself.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.220
This character profile you wrote

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.400
completely fails to show

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.120
Shanlan's appeal.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.200
Come.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.400
Let's analyze

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.720
how to find this character's charm.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.800
She can

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.000
do things

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.210
that don't make logical sense.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.160
But they must be consistent with her personality.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.970
You can't just analyze her life story.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.160
You need to fill in her character background yourself.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.880
You even

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.600
need to create

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.520
events that are important to her.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.240
He got away.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.800
Xiaoying.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.290
Why can't I see her anymore?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.050
Who did this?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.960
Why are they stopping me from seeing Xiaoying?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.690
It must be her boss, Shen Yifan.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.080
He's the one who made her film those exhausting fight scenes.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.400
Always following her.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.400
Controlling her.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.920
Xiaoying.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.960
Don't be afraid.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.280
I...

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.440
I'm coming to save you right now.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.480
Where could he be rushing off to?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.680
Excuse me, who are you?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.560
If you don't come with me,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.420
I'll detonate the bomb in the car.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Think carefully.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.360
Hitting me with a stick

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.960
and causing moderate injury

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.840
will get you at least 3 to 5 years,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.240
or up to 8 to 10 years. Is it worth it?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.080
So...

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.490
what should I do?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.440
There are too many people in the hotel. Keep him calm first

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.560
to prevent the explosion from hurting innocent people.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.040
I've already held out my hands.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.240
Don't tell me you didn't bring any rope?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.180
Your cross knot is completely wrong.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.520
Look.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.240
Hold this, I'll teach you.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.920
Wrap it around twice like this.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.760
Then wrap it this way.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.170
Now, thread it through the middle.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.409
What's next?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.100
Should I get in the car?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.560
Why are you just standing there? Open the door.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.720
If you don't blindfold me,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.600
I'll be able to tell

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.080
that we're going to Shimo Mountain, right?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.010
Shimo Mountain.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.880
Untie me.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.080
What if you run away?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.000
We're on a mountain now.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.330
We're on a mountain now.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.280
There's no one for miles around.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.200
Highway on the left, cliff on the right.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.860
Where could I possibly run to?

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.320
Look.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.840
Do you like it?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.960
Not bad.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.920
If we weren't in the southeast corner,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.800
we wouldn't see such a beautiful view.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.920
I remember you once said

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.360
that you love standing on mountains looking down.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.490
You feel like the whole world is yours.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.840
I just love the stars in the sky.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.160
You shine like the stars in the sky.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.160
You're so beautiful, so dazzling.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.120
I know.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.970
I'm not worthy of you right now,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.480
but if you're willing to give me a chance,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.360
wait for me.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.640
I, Wang Lin, will definitely treat you well in the future.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.000
You're waiting for Shen Yifan, aren't you?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.760
I...

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.240
I'm just looking around.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.480
Just looking around?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.880
I like you so much.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.040
I came all this way to see you,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.570
and this is how you treat me?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.640
You're with me

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.440
but thinking about another man.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.000
Is this how you treat me?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.040
Xiaoying.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.730
Since you're so heartless,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.580
don't blame me for what happens next.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.480
If you don't show up soon,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.200
this once-in-a-millennium chance to be my hero

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.400
will be gone.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.480
Let go!

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.760
Let go!

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.320
Police! Freeze!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.560
Stay put. Get down.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.400
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:49.920
Let go!

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.920
Thank goodness you're okay.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.320
Don't ever do this again.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.040
Oh my god.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.120
These obsessive fans are terrifying nowadays.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.640
They even follow you home.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.400
Look.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.730
Would this work?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.440
Contact immediately

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.880
the security company we've been working with.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.160
Now. Right now.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.530
Still thinking about Wang Lin?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.380
I'm thinking about

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.240
what approach I should take

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.200
to guide my fans

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.480
to do what they should be doing.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.760
Celebrities do have a strong halo effect.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.490
They should set a good example.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.880
Rather than me being cold,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.800
I'm more worried about you catching a cold.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.120
One day everyone will see that

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.720
I'm an actress who wants to be recognized

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.120
for my talent,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.090
not just someone who knows how to create hype.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.960
I have my own aspirations,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.050
and I'm working hard toward my dreams.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.440
I believe

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.450
my fans are the same way.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.040
Everyone is unique.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.540
You can't imitate others,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.520
and others can't replicate you.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.050
Everyone has their own path to follow.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.800
But I still need to be careful,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.280
so that some irrational fans

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.170
don't get jealous and hurt you.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.840
It's fine.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.210
Have you two been together for a long time?

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.520
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.240
Of course not.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.440
We

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.640
never intended to hide it from you.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.770
Enough, Shen Yifan.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.620
Let me tell you now.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.960
I don't care if she

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.360
is with you now.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.040
I will absolutely not give up.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.570
When it comes to Zheng Ying,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.760
I will never give up.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.360
Of course, if you mind...

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.090
I don't mind.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.000
You liking her is your business.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.940
Whatever you want to do

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.080
is up to you.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.770
I don't mind because

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.210
you can't take her away from me,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.720
and you can't beat me.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.240
Like this. Add a spin.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.200
Strike.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.960
Not bad.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.560
That action scene just now

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.680
was well executed.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.840
Keep up the good work.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.570
Yes, Master.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.820
Director Zhou.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.770
Let's go, Director.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.800
Look at this.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240
This move of yours

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.960
actually still needs work.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.920
Xiaoying, can I take a photo with you?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920
I'm so happy to be filming

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.080
with you this time.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.160
Sure.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Thank you, Xiaoying.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.040
Xiaoying, can you take a photo

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.840
with us, please?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.320
Okay.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.000
Thanks!

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.450
Come.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.000
I'm sorry,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.280
Xiaoying needs to change her makeup soon.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.410
We can take photos another time, okay?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.370
Your timing is perfect.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.080
You on one side, Wan Yuchen on the other.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.560
You think I can be in two places at once?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.840
Just the two of us?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.840
You must have another side job.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.920
Well...

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.680
No, where's your boyfriend?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.410
Did he leave?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.120
Why aren't you as enthusiastic as before?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.880
We're keeping a low profile, understand?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.520
Now you know about keeping a low profile.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.240
We were just colleagues before.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.680
Nothing to hide then.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.480
Now you're dating,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.920
you should be even less concerned about appearances.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.120
Unless...

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.680
you two are doing something inappropriate

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.080
in broad daylight.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.000
If you ask me, you don't need to worry.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.120
Shen Yifan is totally the reserved type.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.880
That kind of man can't even be seduced.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.240
Let me tell you...

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.560
Hey, darling.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.800
Did you hear all that?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.280
Yes, that's Yu Youyi.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.410
Years of friendship can't compare to one man.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.050
How was your first day of shooting?

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.000
It went well.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.400
It's just that

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.450
I'm not quite used to it.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.170
What aren't you used to?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.800
The food.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.600
The boxed meals aren't good.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.520
Then

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.720
take a look in the fridge.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.359
How did you know I wanted these?

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.480
Look under the table too.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.099
When you're tired, you can soak your feet and relax.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.060
You can also make your own snacks if you want.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.480
You've prepared quite thoroughly.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.220
But it's still not enough.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.240
I miss my boyfriend.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.440
Can you have one delivered to me?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.760
Of course.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.920
There might be some shipping delays though.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.680
Can you wait?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.290
Of course I can wait.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.800
By the way.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.680
I've prepared a gift for you too.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.560
A gift?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.360
10 o'clock.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.360
Dried fruit to boost your vitamin C.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.800
Energy for the whole day.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.120
1 PM.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.440
Afternoon tea snack.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.320
Mix with warm water to aid digestion.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.840
Makes you feel great.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.640
4 PM.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.200
Snacks to fully recharge you.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.280
8 PM.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.440
Calming tea powder. Sleep soundly till morning.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.200
Cut!

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.170
Not bad. Let's prepare for the next scene.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.960
Angelica egg and brown sugar drink.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.480
Don't look at me. I didn't prepare it.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.940
Your husband prepared it.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.400
He's here?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.320
He arranged it remotely.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.360
As if you deserve it.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.560
Keep standing there.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.440
Cut!

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.000
Okay.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.680
What scene are you acting out?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.200
It's your husband.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.320
He knows you have a water-splashing scene today.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.520
He specifically asked me to check on you.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.240
He's here.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.620
Come on.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.600
Smile! I need to take a photo to check in.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.820
I'll send it to him too.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.730
What do you need a knife for?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.740
I want to try my skills.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.080
Here's an extraordinary...

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:49.960
Knife.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.770
I didn't know you had such amazing skills.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.920
Well.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.360
The way you're flailing around

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.800
makes it hard to focus.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.130
I can't help it. I attract mosquitoes.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.680
Thank you.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.890
Our guest star, award-winning actress Ms. Ni Shang.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.280
Shen Yifan sent it.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.500
Looks like it's meant for you.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.680
He sent it?

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.400
Are you okay, Ms. Zheng?

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.240
I'm fine.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.530
Director, let's continue.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.220
Come on.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.960
Alright, ready.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.360
Action.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.840
Forget it.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.240
Better not make him worry.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.040
Shen.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.650
Why are you here?

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920
Give me your hand.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.400
No need, I can do it myself.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.930
Just listen to me this once.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.580
In your heart, he might seem perfect.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360
But in my opinion,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.400
he's not a qualified boyfriend.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.240
He's not what you think.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.970
Listen to me.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.220
The old man wants me to go back.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.130
It's urgent.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.680
I might not be able

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.040
to watch over you at the set every day.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.100
But remember this.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.480
Fame brings trouble.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.320
I worry about you,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.050
so I asked him to accompany you.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.410
Let me emphasize again.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.000
This doesn't mean I'm giving up.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.120
Where is everyone?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.970
Which outfit should I wear for the next scene?

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.520
Is it this one?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.600
Why are you here?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160
You said

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.360
you wanted a boyfriend delivered here.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.200
Is your hand still hurting?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.640
Not anymore.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.040
Who put this plaster on?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.380
I'll put a new one on for you later.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.320
What are you smiling at?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.680
You're jealous.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.880
Come here.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.760
Sir.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.000
At a time like this,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.040
shouldn't you show some restraint?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.160
I'm jealous

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760
and can't help it.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.570
I asked Wu Yu to send everyone away.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.000
They should all be having coffee by now.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.880
Why is your style different today?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.250
You've turned into a sighing Zheng Daiyu.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.160
It feels like forever since I last saw him.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.960
I miss him so much.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.440
You just saw each other 10 minutes ago.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.320
We're filming right now.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.650
I'm the male lead standing in front of you.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.680
If only the male lead in this film with me

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.040
could be him instead.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.080
You can use your imagination.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.160
Just pretend I'm him.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.600
This human prop doesn't mind at all.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.240
That's actually a good idea.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.560
General,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.640
you've done great service in repelling the enemy this time.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.560
The Emperor hinted that you should become a royal son-in-law.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.920
Why did you refuse?

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.480
A man's ambition lies in the four corners of the world.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.880
Why bother with romance?

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.800
Life is long.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.250
Should the rest of my bright future

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.000
be tied to a woman's hand?

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.840
Who?

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.330
I fell in love with you at first sight when I was 16.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.080
You promised me I would be a general's wife.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.010
Now you're going back on your word.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.240
Who?

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.080
Thanks.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.040
Did I say you could leave?

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.240
You really don't know how to treat a lady.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.840
