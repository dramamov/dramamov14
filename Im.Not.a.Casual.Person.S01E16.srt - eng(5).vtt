00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.920
That's wonderful!

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.650
Yes, indeed.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.039
Heroine Zheng Ying, fighting against injustice!

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.200
She's coming!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.460
Everyone, please quiet down.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Let's welcome

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.320
the new leader of the martial arts alliance,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.720
heroine Zheng Ying!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:15.360
[Zheng Ying]

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.400
I've been crazy about becoming famous.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.120
Hey!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.930
Check out the trending topics!

[Coincidence upon coincidence]

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.800
I...

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.360
I've really made it big!

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.290
I didn't expect Zheng Ying would be so entertaining on the show.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.600
You all should watch the first episode.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.000
Zheng Ying is hilarious!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
[Welding]

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520
Zheng Ying, you're famous now!

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.320
That's right,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.220
you've made it!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.560
What's wrong?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.170
You still don't believe it?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.520
Why is this bag so heavy?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.880
Let me handle this kind of stuff from now on.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.140
How can we let a female celebrity do this?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.420
Look at your attitude.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.240
Those who know would say you're famous,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.280
but others might think you're about to be crowned emperor.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.960
I just became famous.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.610
Don't I deserve to enjoy it?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.480
Here they come!

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.940
Welcome, Sister Ying!

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000
Welcome, Sister Ying!

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.450
Sister Ying!

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.000
Alright, alright.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.460
Come on.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.600
How is it? Is the celebrity satisfied?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.360
Congratulations, Sister Ying!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.079
It's okay,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.620
but there's still room for improvement.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.050
And there's that...

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.920
Not bad.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.180
I can see you put a lot of effort into this.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.160
Nice! You even prepared gifts for me.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.980
Let me tell you,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.240
we didn't prepare these.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.560
These were all sent

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.620
by your real fans early this morning.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.680
So this is what it feels like to be famous!

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.240
This one is complimenting my looks.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.420
Seems like they're my beauty fan.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.440
This one is praising my figure.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.040
Not bad.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.680
The little girl has good taste.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.080
This one...

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360
The handwriting looks like a boy's.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.360
Look, so many people like me.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.520
Why am I so perfect?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.720
This is called the halo effect.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.480
Many celebrities are liked by fans

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.520
because of certain qualities they possess

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.840
that attract fans.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.080
For example,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.720
good acting, good looks, good figure,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.400
or even strong variety show presence.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.640
These qualities gradually get magnified

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640
and may even overshadow other aspects,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.720
just like a halo

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.290
spreading outward.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.600
It's like loving the whole package.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.760
I've heard this term in psychology.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.520
So,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.280
what should we do with these gifts?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.960
Wu Yu,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.210
we've analyzed your fan demographics

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.460
and concluded that

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.240
your fans are relatively young on average

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.360
and don't have sufficient financial means yet.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.960
So apart from these letters,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.050
all gifts will be returned.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.520
Also,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.400
we'll add some new gifts

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.760
to return to them together,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.090
while telling them that

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.720
compared to gifts,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.320
their sentiment of liking Zheng Ying

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.380
is more important.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.530
Understood.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.330
Miss Celebrity,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.080
is this handling okay

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.120
with you?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.200
Yes, very satisfied.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.000
I really like this one.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.280
Can I keep it?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.760
Fine.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.440
The variety show part is almost done.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.640
The most important task now

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.120
is the drama 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.920
But there are still some issues.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.320
Mr. Cheng, this is...

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.200
Isn't there an issue with 'Drunken Jade Mountain'?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200
I'll handle it.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.560
After all, it concerns Zheng Ying.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.690
It wouldn't be appropriate if I didn't come personally.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800
Please continue.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.120
What about the first draft of the script?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.920
There's a problem, right?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.050
I'll take care of it.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.610
Mr. Cheng

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.080
The first draft of the script has been approved

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.040
and the platform is very satisfied.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880
Moreover,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.440
our project

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.680
has already been registered with the central bureau.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.520
Continue.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400
The next step

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.060
is to prepare for production.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.120
About the director...

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.680
No problem.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.320
I know many famous directors,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.680
absolutely no problem.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.240
Mr. Cheng,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.280
we've already signed a contract with Director Cai Dou.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.960
Two weeks ago,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.000
he started working with the writing team

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.240
to revise the script.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.200
Go on.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.010
The most important issue now is

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.659
we haven't confirmed a producer yet.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.240
He Zhi?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.200
He Zhi is one of the

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.930
top producers in the industry.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.560
People call him 'Omnipresent Director He.'

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.400
However,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.360
he's very picky about projects.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.220
He won't participate in projects that aren't good.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.080
I heard people who want to work with him

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.320
are lined up for years.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.760
Others are others,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.520
I am Cheng Moyang.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.400
Tomorrow at this time,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.930
I'll have him meet with you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.680
Mr. Shen,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.250
should we trust him?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.760
Since Mr. Cheng is so enthusiastic,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.419
let's not dampen his spirits.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.780
Which actors have been confirmed so far?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.900
Then it's settled.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.120
Let's play golf together sometime, Mr. He.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.600
Great, that works.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.810
The usual place?

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.600
Sure, sure.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.640
Okay.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.080
Goodbye, Mr. He.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.760
I see your courage

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.280
is growing bolder and bolder.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.520
You didn't even ask me

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.560
before approaching He Zhi.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.690
If I asked you, would you have let me go?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.620
See? That's exactly why I didn't ask you.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.680
You're my son.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.580
I know you better than anyone.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.970
Your current abilities

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.240
aren't sufficient to lead a project.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.400
Well, let me tell you.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.080
I will definitely make this project successful.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.520
Think about it.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.120
Have you ever successfully completed anything in your life?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.600
What can you do besides disappointing me?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600
Since you think so little of me,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.920
why did you keep me?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.640
I could have gone with my mother.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.080
Hello, all your dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.680
Thank you.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.600
I thought you were someone who would show gratitude.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.640
You helped me at the award ceremony,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.720
and I did promise to treat you to a meal.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.840
But demanding a five-star restaurant

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.040
isn't that a bit much?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.920
But surely not this place, right?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.720
Mr. Cheng,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.400
if you want a chance to repay me,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.320
then stay.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.220
Otherwise,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.450
goodbye and good riddance.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.720
What are you laughing at?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.220
Let me tell you something.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.640
The barbecue skewers here are absolutely amazing.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.440
After eating them,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.800
you'll definitely forget all your troubles.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm not unhappy.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.730
Has anyone ever told you

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.040
that you eat rather unattractively?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.170
Of course they have.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.170
Let me think.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.120
Some people say I seem outgoing,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.250
but I'm actually just a fake nice girl.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.080
Others say

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.080
I radiate this kind of

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.560
inexplicable confidence.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.220
Who knows where it comes from.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.280
And some say

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.320
I must have used some questionable methods

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.800
to climb to my current position.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.480
Okay, okay.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.850
So you don't care about any of these comments?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.250
Of course I care.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.560
But what good does caring do?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.360
No matter what you do,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.800
people will always question you.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.400
They'll criticize you,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.960
saying this isn't good, that isn't right.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.600
Right?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.920
Even if you were money,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.980
some people still wouldn't like you.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.920
So the best way to face criticism is

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.560
to just go ahead and do it anyway.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.760
Do what you want to do.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.120
As long as we succeed,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.680
we can shut those people up.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.680
Okay.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.620
Try it quickly.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.320
Fine.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.000
How is it? Is it good?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.080
I wasn't lying, was I?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080
It's pretty good.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.080
Of course it is.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.000
Well...

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.700
I shouldn't have eaten so much barbecue.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.280
If not, we can just go back downstairs again.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.680
Okay. I think that outfit really suits you.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.570
It's really Zheng Ying!

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720
I'm such a big fan of yours!

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.180
Can I take a photo with you?

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.760
Me too!

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.080
I want one too! Zheng Ying, can I take a photo with you?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.720
Um...

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.680
My stomach hurts a little.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.920
Could I go inside first?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.680
Okay.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.400
Zheng Ying

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.200
I really like you.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.880
I really like you.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:25.640
No.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.080
Thank you.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.880
Excuse me.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.520
Thanks.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.720
Make way.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.760
Let me through.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.320
Stop pushing.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.080
Zheng Ying

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.560
Alright, stop pushing.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.100
They're gone now. Stop crowding.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.320
Are you okay?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.250
Don't worry.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.810
This little situation won't scare me.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.050
You don't need to

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.810
act tough in front of me.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.620
You've been through a lot.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.160
Since I've gained everyone's attention,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.360
I naturally have to sacrifice some freedom.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.760
That's the price of fame.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.960
I understand.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.120
We've put in so much effort

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.520
to get where we are today.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.160
How many others are there

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.000
just like me,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.840
who've struggled for years and remain unknown?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.640
I've already achieved

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.570
so much that they can only dream of.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.640
If I still feel sorry for myself,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.370
wouldn't that be too self-indulgent?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.210
So you're not afraid

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.050
that something like this might happen again?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.260
No, I'm not.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.680
Because

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800
I have even higher goals to achieve.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.080
Because you'll always be by my side.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.120
Get some good rest when you get back.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.040
Leave the rest to me.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.440
Can we really just leave like this?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.130
This was already part of the work plan.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.560
Why are you so surprised?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.120
He really didn't arrange this

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120
specially for me.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.520
'Drunken Jade Mountain' has started pre-production.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.520
The company planned for you

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.360
to have some time

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.160
to experience the character before joining the crew.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.080
After all, this is your first time playing a leading role.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.080
It's just that the location wasn't supposed to be here,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.160
and someone moved

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.760
the schedule up by a few days.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.600
This really is the taste of freedom.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.490
Alright, come back.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.040
Coming.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.040
Director Cai.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.160
Nice to meet you.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.960
Let me arrange things for everyone.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.840
Let me make some introductions.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.200
This is our director,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.440
Cai Dou, Director Cai.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.000
He will be here

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.730
guiding you through your character experience.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.520
This person needs no introduction,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.200
Master Zhou.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.460
He will be here to guide you through all your action scenes.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.080
Next is my turn.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.360
I am the investor of this film,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.400
Cheng Moyang.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.400
I'll also be here accompanying you,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.240
making sure you follow the work schedule

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.370
and complete all preparations before joining the crew.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.540
In a moment,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.600
you should have a meeting with the director and others.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.130
Go ahead.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.760
Come.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.220
That's enough.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.640
You've already delivered your artist.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.960
I'll take full responsibility from now on.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960
You can go now.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.680
How can you be so rude?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.280
Do you still consider me a friend?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.319
We're going back today,

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.050
just in time to meet with Mr. Shen and the doctors.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.440
This is truly the taste of freedom.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.849
Alright, come back.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040
Starting today,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.360
you need to be here morning and evening,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.120
run 10 kilometers,

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.320
and then go see the director.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.050
Understand?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.320
As long as I can improve my physical condition quickly

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.560
and get into character.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.680
Never mind 10 kilometers,

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.940
I can do 20 kilometers.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.330
I'm leaving.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.440
Are you okay?

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.360
I'm fine.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.160
Thank you.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.130
You're welcome.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.680
Hello, Director Cai.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560
Where's your phone?

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560
Didn't you say

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.890
to leave it in the room and not bring it out?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.160
This is for you.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.440
To help you quickly get into the role of Shanlan.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.240
From today on,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.760
you must live as Shanlan.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.570
You told me not to bring my phone

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.960
and wear her clothes.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.440
Is that also for this reason?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.240
Phone dependency

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.840
is the biggest difference

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.080
between ancient and modern people's lives.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.360
Five hours every day.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.320
Come sit here.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.680
Empty your mind

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.100
to truly enter the character.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.920
Is anybody there?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.640
No. This approach is meant to help me

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.200
understand the character more deeply.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.160
I can't ask him for help.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.800
Mr. Shen.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.960
We have real-name registration here.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.840
All the guest names are right here.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.640
After your film crew checked in,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.400
Mr. Cheng booked the entire place.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.080
So,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.840
we only have people from your crew here.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.040
There's nobody else.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.960
I knew it.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.200
You need a towel.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.340
When you go running tomorrow,

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.500
take this with you.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.720
It'll be like I'm there with you.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.130
Mr. Shen,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.640
are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.680
The manager already said there was no one else.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.080
I must ensure her safety.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.000
If they're really after her,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.730
what might they do next?

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.120
Mr. Shen, Miss Zheng Ying's room is right this way.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.530
What are you doing here?

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.400
I was worried you'd be hungry, so I brought you something to eat.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.000
Quick!

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.480
I'm literally starving.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.800
Where's the key card?

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.920
Since you're here, could you help me open the door?

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.680
Sure.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.530
Are you coming into my room too?

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.080
I'd like to discuss some work matters with you.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.810
Is that okay?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.780
What are you doing in my bathroom?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
Washing my hands.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.010
Weren't you supposed to discuss work with me?

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.380
Just a moment. Coming.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440
You said you wanted to talk about work,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.440
but you haven't said a word about it.
