WEBVTT

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
This time we must succeed.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.720
We cannot fail.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.400
Are we

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.360
killing again?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.240
What's wrong?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.060
Getting cold feet?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.330
Seems you're not used to it yet.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.539
Killing one person

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.940
versus killing ten

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.080
is different after all.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.080
What's the difference?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.360
They're all capital crimes.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.600
Isn't it a bit late

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.220
to value your life now?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.360
I remember what you cherish most

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
isn't your own life, is it?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.560
Have you forgotten that

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.960
your sister is still abroad?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.200
With the top medical team

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.640
enjoying treatments she doesn't deserve.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.000
Spending huge amounts of money every day

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.920
trying to defy fate.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.000
You know very well my current situation in the company.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880
If I fall,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.130
there will be no one to save her.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.930
Just remove the oxygen tube

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.720
and let fate decide.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.640
Okay?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.120
No!

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520
She must be saved.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.840
She must be saved!

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:38.880
Dr. Dai said

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.440
the patient's condition has indeed improved significantly.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.760
I estimate in about a week

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.620
he should regain consciousness.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.600
Okay.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.720
If he wakes up,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.040
please notify us immediately.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.360
Sure.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.079
No problem.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.930
Captain Luo,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040
I'm heading back to the station now.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
I killed someone.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
I killed someone.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.200
How did you kill them?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.000
Tell me.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.080
I just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.560
well...

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.640
entered the password

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.280
and went in.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.560
Then...

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.530
Why did you come?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.060
What were you doing there?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.050
After killing them,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.200
I was

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.920
really panicked.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840
So I set a fire.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.600
And ran away.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.720
Lao Ning,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.700
how's it going?

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.120
The crime scene investigation

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.480
my part is already done.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.200
We found two victims,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.880
both male,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520
with stab wounds on their bodies.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.440
But judging from these wounds,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.720
they probably weren't fatal.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.440
I just

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.480
did a quick examination of

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.560
their respiratory tracts.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.280
There's ash

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.240
and smoke residue,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.040
but not much.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.040
So my preliminary conclusion is

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.800
they were stabbed first

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.480
and then the fire was set afterward.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.080
But for the exact cause of death,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.480
I'll need to take them back for examination.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.080
The 15th isn't even over yet

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.840
and I'm already annoyed.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.320
Captain Luo.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.959
The point of origin should be

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.760
the silk curtains that were hanging there.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.480
They were ignited,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.760
causing the fire to spread widely.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.080
Plus the room had large carpeted areas,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.680
so the fire spread very quickly.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.400
As for the victims...

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.040
They are Fang Xiaofeng who lives in apartment 601

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.159
and Dong Chengbin from next door, apartment 602.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.360
The bodies were found in apartment 601.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.200
Have you checked the surveillance footage?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000
Yes, we have.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.640
No one was captured entering Building 8.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.080
The crime was most likely committed by someone inside the building.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.680
Why did you kill both of them?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.440
How did you get the password for apartment 601?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.200
I was just greedy

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.130
and lost my mind.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.680
I live in apartment 606.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.810
That Fang Xiaofeng,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.960
I often saw him bringing home lots of luxury items.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.820
They were obviously ill-gotten.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.160
That day, Fang Xiaofeng was drunk

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.400
and carrying a bunch of luxury goods home again.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.920
No,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.580
your apartment is over there.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.540
But he couldn't get his door open.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.340
I guess he couldn't see clearly who I was,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.720
so he told me the password

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.620
and asked me to help him open the door.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.520
Then I memorized the password.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600
Thanks, buddy.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.360
It didn't make sense.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.640
He lived in this kind of neighborhood

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.640
but bought such expensive watches.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.760
At first,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.159
I just wanted to steal things from apartment 601.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.920
Because Fang Xiaofeng,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.000
he was always out all night.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.220
Who knew he would be home that day.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.360
How did you get in?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.240
I acted on impulse.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.320
So I killed him.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.600
That Dong Chengbin happened to witness the murder.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120
I had no choice.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.920
So I

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.320
had to close his account too.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.000
The crime scene is in Hengxiang Residence.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.880
It's in Xin'an District,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.160
an old neighborhood.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.640
The fire started in

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.320
Building 8, Unit 601.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.200
This one.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.320
The two victims:

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.040
Fang Xiaofeng

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.100
and Dong Chengbin.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.810
Both had sharp weapon wounds on their bodies.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.640
We also found this at the scene,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.700
the murder weapon.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.360
But on this,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.560
we couldn't extract any valid biological information.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680
The victim Dong Chengbin

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.740
after his divorce,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.040
had been living alone.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.200
The victim Fang Xiaofeng's

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200
wife

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.050
is named Lu Ningzhi.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.520
She's a yoga studio instructor.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.560
At the time of the incident,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.620
she wasn't at home.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.800
These

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.880
are the accessories we found in Fang Xiaofeng's home.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.740
There's a gold-plated bracelet,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.380
a Tianyu jade ring,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.680
and a Rolex watch.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720
I've had them appraised.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.680
They're all authentic

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.140
and extremely expensive.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.440
But considering Fang Xiaofeng and

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.320
Lu Ningzhi's financial situation,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.400
they couldn't possibly afford these items.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.320
So I think

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.980
we need to investigate this thoroughly.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.800
So what Zhu Chongliang said,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.880
although it sounds a bit foolish,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.800
basically matches the actual situation.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.440
From what we know now,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.840
that seems to be the case.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.520
Alright.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.840
It'll be dawn soon.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.960
Let's rest here.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.880
The victim's family has been notified to come.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.080
Today we'll do this:

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.340
meet with the victim's family

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.700
while waiting for Lao Ning's detailed autopsy report.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.640
Mr. K.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.040
What's my next mission?

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.580
Your mission is complete.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.320
You did an excellent job.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.840
Take some rest now.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.880
No.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.600
Mr. K.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.400
I know I made a mistake.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.760
I shouldn't have acted on my own

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.160
and interfered with your plans.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.400
But I'm already making up for my mistake.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.320
You trust me.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.980
Please trust me one more time.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.400
Chi Xiao.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440
You might have a chance

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.100
to become a perfect executor.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.200
But I just told you,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.980
your mission is complete.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.679
Mr. K.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.080
Give me another chance.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.919
I'll try to stimulate Chi Xia's memory recovery.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.120
Just one more chance.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.440
Mr. K.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.050
Recently, Chi Xia's

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.480
major crime unit

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.680
is indeed investigating an arson case.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.680
I know.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.600
Following the timeline,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.490
the next significant event for Chi Xia

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.160
is when she left the base.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.520
It seems Old K

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.640
wants to recreate that fire

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.890
to trigger Chi Xia's memory recovery.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.640
The base

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.560
has indeed had several personnel transfers recently.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.690
Many people have arrived in Dongzhou.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.720
Ade,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.040
don't come to the boxing gym for now.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.440
Protect Chi Xia secretly

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.800
and try not to leave her alone.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.600
Understood.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.620
What happened at Bailong Resort,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.690
I don't want it to happen again.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.840
But, young master...

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.040
Those memories are painful for Chi Xia.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.380
I don't want her to be driven to desperation.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.320
So you...

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.400
I...

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.770
Try not to raise suspicion from the organization

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840
while helping her

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.280
and keeping her safe.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.960
Don't worry.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.680
Thank you.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.480
Ms. Lu.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.200
Where were you

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.520
when the fire broke out last night?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.580
At the yoga studio.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.640
Some classrooms at the yoga studio are being renovated.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.320
Classes during the day need quiet,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.040
so the work is usually done at night.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.560
Last night we worked until very late,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.680
so I didn't go home.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.160
What happened to your hand?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.540
Fang Xiaofeng called.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.400
We were once

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.100
deeply in love.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.320
But after many years,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.800
the love has worn away.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.420
I know he's unfaithful

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.010
and I know he cheats.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.920
Come here.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.240
Either leave me

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.720
or stay out of my business.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.320
If you keep nagging,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.560
I'll mess up your face so badly

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.890
no makeup will cover it.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.240
Get out.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Fang Xiaofeng.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.490
He cheated on you

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.880
and abused you.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.360
Haven't you thought about divorce?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.160
No.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.560
Never.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.600
Our relationship is just like this.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.920
I don't know if there's any love left,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.120
but I can't leave him.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.520
This is my sorrow.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.200
I don't blame anyone.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.820
Have you ever thought about killing him?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.360
Yes, I have.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.520
I've thought about it countless times.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.360
I love him.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.580
But I also hate him.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.800
I've fantasized countless times

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.930
about dying together with him.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.090
But then I realized.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.680
I'd rather live like this, tormenting each other.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.880
Last night, another person was killed

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.800
along with them - one of your neighbors.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.260
His name is Dong Chengbin.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.040
How was your relationship with him?

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.840
Just casual.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.380
We only nodded when we met.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.640
What about Fang Xiaofeng's relationship with him?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.440
He looked down on Dong Chengbin.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.880
Why?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.460
Perhaps they look too much alike.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.880
Officer.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.320
If there's nothing else,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.600
may I leave now?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.320
Because

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.640
I have yoga classes to teach this afternoon.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.440
Yes,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.640
you may go.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.680
If necessary,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.760
we'll contact you again.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.560
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.560
She's too calm.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.320
Yes.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.080
Whatever we ask,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.160
she answers.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.000
Nothing is hidden.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.560
Throughout the interview, she's conveying one message:

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.600
that as the victim's wife,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.600
she has the strongest motive to kill her husband.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.220
But she remains completely calm,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.600
as if telling someone else's story.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.800
Here are the autopsy reports of the two victims.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.440
Fang Xiaofeng's body did contain

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.600
traces of alcohol,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.320
but in both victims' bodies,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.800
we also detected

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.600
the presence of certain drugs.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.210
From this I can conclude

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.800
that before they suffered stab wounds,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.680
they were most likely

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.720
already unconscious.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.400
Zhu Chongliang is lying.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.160
Captain Luo.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.120
Zhu Chongliang has changed his testimony.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.840
He confessed that

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.160
before stabbing the two victims to death,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.960
he had injected them with nerve paralyzing drugs.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.000
Talk.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.720
Why did you initially conceal

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.800
the fact that you injected the victims with drugs?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.840
I killed them.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.680
That's right.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.920
I killed them.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.170
Then repeat the process of your crime.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.130
Think carefully before you speak.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.600
Did you remember something?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.320
Or did you overlook something?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.560
Or if there's anything you want to tell us,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.890
you can share it with us.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.680
That day, I

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.450
heard shouting.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.480
Let me go!

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.280
One last time.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.240
Just one last time.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.800
Let go of me!

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.930
Just this last time.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.800
Don't push your luck.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.840
No!

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.760
Stay back!

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.160
Who are you?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.080
Still lying?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.040
Lu Ningzhi has a solid alibi.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.600
She didn't go home last night at all.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
She was supervising renovations at the yoga studio.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.560
We've confirmed this with the construction workers.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.360
No.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.410
That's not true.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.560
Fang Xiaofeng and Dong Chengbin's bodies

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.160
were found in room 601.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.680
Yet you claim you killed them in room 602.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.520
Besides,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.480
if what you said was true,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.720
if you were so compassionate to the point of murder,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.600
why did you prepare syringes in advance?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.400
That's not it.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.280
I...

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.140
I killed Fang Xiaofeng first.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.400
It was Fang Xiaofeng.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.320
Fang Xiaofeng.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.360
No.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.690
Where is Dong Chengbin?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.720
Dong.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.050
Where is Dong Chengbin?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.600
Ningning.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.240
Ningning.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.760
You.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.820
What have you done?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.840
It's a shadow.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.319
No.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:04.920
It's...

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.720
It's me.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.839
I killed someone.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.280
I've killed someone.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.000
Zhu Chongliang, calm down.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.040
I killed...

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.099
Someone come here!

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.329
Zhu Chongliang.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.720
Hurry!

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.130
The family is waiting outside.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.600
The victim's body contains a nerve-paralyzing drug.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.240
If my deduction is correct,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.920
this was a premeditated murder.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.840
We can all see that

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.680
Zhu Chongliang's mental state is abnormal.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.520
Someone like him

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.080
couldn't carry out such a task

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.800
because there are too many variables.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.040
But I still believe

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.080
he must know something.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.850
You suspect he's a witness?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.640
Unfortunately,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640
he can't remember what happened during the incident.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.680
However, I think

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.450
the shadow he mentioned

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.860
must be the killer.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.640
This Zhu Chongliang

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.360
is similar to that

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.080
old lady Zheng Lanshu.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.760
Both mentally disturbed

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.040
and unable to recognize reality.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.440
Could it be the Fox again?

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.000
Hard to say.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.240
This Zhu Chongliang was probably brainwashed

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.680
to deliberately turn himself in

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.920
and take the blame for someone else.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.280
If it is the Fox,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.000
where has he hidden

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.240
the number this time?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.780
Senior, what do you think?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.520
I traced the watch's serial number

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.640
and found the Rolex buyer

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.640
is a rich kid named Chen Lingxin.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.920
She frequents bars.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.120
And guess what?

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.840
She once threatened to burn Fang Xiaofeng alive.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.640
Okay.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.720
I got it.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.360
Let me assign tasks now.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.320
Binzi,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.960
keep watching Zhu Chongliang.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.400
When he wakes up,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.080
notify me immediately.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.760
Understood.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.440
Juanmao,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480
go back and help your senior.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.080
Look into this Chen Lingxin.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.920
Come with me to the crime scene

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.440
to see if we missed any clues.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.040
And also,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.960
let's visit Zhu Chongliang's home again.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.290
That's the plan for now.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.330
No matter what shadow it is,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.200
we'll use a mirror to expose it.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.840
Let's go.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.240
Tao Han's father

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.760
caused a traffic accident five years ago

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.890
that killed Lu Ningzhi's stepfather.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.160
The traffic accident that caused your stepfather's death.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.240
Do you remember?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.280
If a fox is involved in this case,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.240
he fits the profile

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.600
of someone a fox would manipulate.
