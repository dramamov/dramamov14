00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:24.200
(Exciting sound)

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.640
The chicken have been released. Over.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120
(Exciting sound)

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.840
Listen up, you only have 15 minutes.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.680
Team A will rescues the hostage.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.039
While Team B will try to defuse a bomb. And most importantly,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.720
remember we have a hostage…

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.880
do not fire your guns if not necessary.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.440
Got it?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.720
Go!

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.120
(Exciting sound)

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.920
(Shooting sound)

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.920
(Shooting sound)

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.560
(Shooting sound)

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.960
(Fighting sound)

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.960
(Shooting sound)

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.320
(Shooting sound)

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.160
(Fighting sound)

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.040
(Fighting sound)

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.200
Section 1, cleared.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:35.280
(Bomb ticking sound)

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.120
Cleared.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.400
(Fighting sound)

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.280
(Shooting sound)

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
(Shooting sound)

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.159
(Shooting sound)

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.640
Hey, cover me.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.600
go!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.000
(Shooting sound)

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.640
Phaya

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.400
Phaya, go!

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.560
Okay.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.640
(Bomb ticking sound)

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.400
You go and handle upstairs.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.600
I’ll take care of them here.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.600
Okay.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.840
Bastard!

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.280
Need any help?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.120
Shut up.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.880
(Door breaking sound)

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.800
A dummy.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.080
Son of a bitch!

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.080
Where’s the hostage?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.120
He’s not here.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.520
We were fooled.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.720
You two try to defuse the bombs here and in that room.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.080
I’ll go rescue the hostage.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.720
Got it?

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:52.400
Let’s go with the yellow one.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.080
Hey!

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.400
(Fighting sound)

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.880
Hey!

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.120
Hey! Yai!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.320
I’m here.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.160
Cleared.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280
Section 3, cleared.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.760
Let’s go and rescue the hostage.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.200
Okay.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.520
There are two bombs on this floor.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.240
You two stay here then.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.760
I’ll go rescue the hostage. Go!

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.120
Khem.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.920
What?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.000
How much time do we have?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.680
7 minutes.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.720
Got it.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.440
Cleared.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.120
(Door breaking sound)

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.280
(Shooting sound)

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.800
Fuck! The hostage isn’t here.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.880
Okay.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.640
(Shooting sound)

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.640
(Shooting sound)

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.160
(Shooting sound)

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.680
Phaya!

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.880
How much time do we have left, Tharn?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.000
5 minutes.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.880
What to do?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.400
Tharn.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.400
Tharn.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.040
Tharn.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.920
Tharn.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.320
Tharn!

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.120
(Shooting sound)

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.120
What the fuck, Chart?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.040
The hostage is mine!

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.000
(Shooting sound)

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.280
Shit!

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.480
(Fighting sound)

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.080
(Fighting sound)

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.440
(Fighting sound)

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.400
Stop it, Chart!

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.520
Hey!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.560
Stop!

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.400
(Fighting sound)

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.200
That’s enough!

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320
Time’s up.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.920
Team A and B, both of you failed to rescue the hostage.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.480
So, both teams will be punished.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.040
The main goal of this training is to create unity among both teams.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.400
If any of you fail,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840
Everyone on the team also fails.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.040
No one will take the responsibility alone.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.720
Working as a team…

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.680
…means that you have to stick together.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.080
And help watch each other’s back.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.800
No one stands out.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.040
No one is better than the others.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.960
You both lose…

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.000
…because you don’t know how to work as a team.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.920
But if we were competing, there must be a winner.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.880
Shouldn’t we play by the rule?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.160
Yes.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.880
But not by doing something nasty like what you did today.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.960
Although the mission always comes first…

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.800
…especially when you are on a real mission.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.960
But I taught you how to fight to protect yourself and others.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.760
Not to destroy one another.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.880
Prepare for push-ups!

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.640
Ready!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.040
Hooya!

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.480
300 push-ups! Go!

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.920
Hooya!

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.520
One

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.320
Two

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.440
Three

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.560
Four

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.800
Five

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.760
Six

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.000
Can you feel the unity among the team now?

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.360
If not…

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.600
…then we’ll keep training like this without any sleep.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.760
Two

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320
Three

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.440
Four

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.680
Five

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.440
Six

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.120
- Do you get it now?
- Seven

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.120
- Eight , Nine
- Can you feel the unity among you now?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.200
Ten

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.320
If not…

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.120
Let me help you.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.840
Prepare for push-ups!

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.920
Ready!

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.680
Hooya!

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.880
Ouch!

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.240
What’s wrong?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.000
Baby, my back hurts.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.040
You cry like a dog.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.840
Ouch!

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.320
Baby, wait for me.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.600
So annoying.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.520
Baby

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.440
Did you go to help Phaya…

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.560
…because you saw that he would be stabbed with the iron rod?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.880
Let’s not talk about it.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.960
Tharn.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.480
If you don’t clarify yourself,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.360
our team might misunderstand…

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.040
…and think that you betrayed us.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.480
Misunderstand?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.880
That’s better those who think I’m crazy.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.400
Like when I was still in school.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.760
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.839
What the fuck is wrong with you, Chart?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.680
It’s your fault.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.319
My team lost because of you!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.520
You shouldn’t even be here!

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.400
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.880
What the fuck?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.120
Tharn.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.840
Hey!

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.280
Stop it, Chart!

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.560
Get off me!

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.040
That’s enough!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.360
It’s over. Why can’t you admit it?

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.840
I never lose!

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.840
Tharn butted in to save you.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.200
You told him to do that, didn’t you?

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.240
- Did you?!
- What are you talking about?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.280
Then don’t butt in.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.440
Let me go!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.560
Just stop it!

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.080
Hey! The instructor is coming.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.840
(Showering sound)

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.440
(Showering sound)

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.960
Ouch!

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.480
Every part of my body hurts. Ouch!

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.720
Will I make it to the end?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.200
- Hey!
- Ouch! My leg.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.480
Are you okay, Khem?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.480
Baby, please help me.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.440
Go help him, Yai.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.920
Fine.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.280
He forgot his shoes.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.360
Geez.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.920
What the fuck are you looking at?

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.120
Bastard.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.000
Hey, leave him.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.600
Let’s gets some sleep.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.360
Ouch.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.040
My leg hurts so much.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.920
And we still have to do that training from hell tomorrow.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.160
Will I survive it, Tharn?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.680
Come on, Yai.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.840
When Sand found out that you sneaked out to have fun…

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.880
…you ran over 10 km. without complaining about your legs.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.000
I wasn’t afraid that my legs would fall off.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.040
I was more afraid that my wife would chop my head off.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.280
(Laughing sound)

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.920
Where is he now?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.920
It’s all because of him…

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.520
…that makes us in trouble like this.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
You shouldn’t have helped him.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.640
Then what? Should I just stand there and watch him die?

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.560
Well…

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.800
But did he even thank you?

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.840
Tharn.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.120
I’m starting to wonder…

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.960
Why do your visions often involve Phaya?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.360
You’ve never…

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.960
…had a vision about me at all.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.720
You already have that amulet you got from the abbot to protect you.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.120
You don’t need my protection.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.160
Fine. But I’m still your brother.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.760
You hardly care about my well-being.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But you seem…

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.600
to care about him a lot.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.120
(Sigh)

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.480
Ouch!

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.960
Hey.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.560
Can we talk?

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.520
How did you know I was going to be stabbed with the iron rod?

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.440
It was surely not a coincidence.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.800
You came to rescue me at the right moment.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.600
You know…

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.480
…that it would happen.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.400
I wasn’t going to help you.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.160
It was a mistake.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.680
I was going to rescue the hostage to end the game.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.680
But then I saw you two fighting like cats and dogs.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.240
I couldn’t help cutting in since both of you are my friends.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.040
Otherwise, I would have won.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.000
Are you sure?

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.440
I already told you.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.080
So, you’re saying that it was a coincidence.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.120
I was saved from getting stabbed by the iron rod…

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.960
because you made a mistake?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.640
What’s done is done. Why don’t you just leave it be?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.480
(Whistle sound)

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.680
Hey.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.800
Hurry up.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.400
I’ll give you 1 minute.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.400
We’ll go swimming today.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.280
Hooya!

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.080
Swimming at 3 in the morning?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.840
Hurry up.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.160
You are about to receive a training from hell.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.240
120 hours from now on…

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.320
or 5 days and 5 nights from now on…

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.040
we’d be training non-stop.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.240
Got it?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.560
Hooya!

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.880
If you think you can’t do it…

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.560
and want to quit,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.520
you can always come out and ring that bell behind me.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.640
Got it?

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.120
Hooya!

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.720
Does anyone want to quit now?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.280
If not…

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.080
Let’s start with some activity to cool down your hot temper.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.640
Take off your clothes. Now!

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.240
Hooya!

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.200
Fill this tank with ice.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.360
This one too.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.960
This one is good.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.320
So is this one.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.720
This is only one of the scenario you will face in the future.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.000
On a real mission, it would be a hundred or thousand times tougher.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.800
What you have to do is endure it.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.120
Use your patience and strength.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.640
And get through it.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.720
Got it?

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.160
Hooya!

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:50.960
Baby,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.120
I’m cold.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.120
Hang in there.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.320
(Breathing sound)

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.680
Instructor.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.480
(Bell sound = Someone quit)

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.640
(Breathing sound)

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360
Stab the neck!

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.960
Aye!

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.600
Slice!

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.280
Aye!

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.000
Slice!

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.840
Aye!

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.360
Chest out!

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.720
Out!

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.880
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.000
If you can’t do it, just go home!

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.040
(Whistle sound)

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.720
Hooya! Hooya!

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.240
Line up!

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.800
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.880
Slice!

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.560
Aye!

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.160
Slice!

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.840
Aye!

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.680
One.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.360
Two.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.960
Three.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.760
Four.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.760
One.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.520
Two.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.200
(Bell sound)

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.640
(Exciting sound)

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:58.120
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.000
Hey!

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.160
Hold it.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.760
Ouch.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.920
What happened?

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.640
If you can’t do it, throw the log away and all of you can leave.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.760
What’s wrong, Tharn?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.600
I saw it again, the vision.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.600
What did you see?

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.640
Are you okay, Chart?

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.520
Fuck off.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.800
You’re trying to slow us down so that Phaya would win, right?

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.320
Asshole.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.800
Enough. Let’s move. Go!

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:54.760
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.160
- Hooya! Hooya!
- Oh!

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.560
Oh!

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.120
Instructor! Someone fell down the hill!

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.320
Move!

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.640
Stand back!

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.400
- Shit!
- Get out of the way!

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.960
Stay still. Don’t move.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.160
Anyone hasn’t got it?

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.360
Hey, don’t look so serious.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.240
This is not the first time, isn’t it?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.480
That you saw a sign in your vision but couldn’t prevent it.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.440
But Chart had to leave the training because of me.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.280
Why couldn’t he just endure it until after tonight.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.000
Tharn, can’t you remember what the abbot said?

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.160
You can’t help save everyone from facing their own karma.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.320
Too bad we couldn’t stay and watch the fire balls with the abbot this year.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.000
He’d probably feel lonely without us.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.120
Captain, how is Chart?

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.200
Time’s up. Go stand in a row of 3.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.560
- Hooya!
- Quick!

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.480
One, two, three! One…

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.560
- Lift up the log.
- Hooya!

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.040
One, two, three!

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.160
Take your log back to the unit.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.160
- Go!
- Hooya!

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760
Pull him up.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.920
(Sigh)

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.280
(Sigh)

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.760
- Is everyone on board there?
- Yes, sir!

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.520
- What about that one?
- Yes, sir!

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.320
One person is missing here.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.560
Phaya.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160
Phaya!

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Phaya!

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.240
Hang on, Tharn!

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.640
We can’t help him. We’re still on a training.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.360
But I saw it.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.080
What did you see?

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.440
Master Sakuna-naparuj, come this way.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.760
Pull him up!

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.000
Phaya.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.239
Phaya.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.680
Geez! I thought I was watching Jack and Rose.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.880
Stop joking around.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.160
The training is over.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.640
You all are the survivors who passes the training.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760
Congratulation.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:42.160
Whoopy! Yay!

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.680
Yah!

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.480
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.960
Congrats, Tharn.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.320
You finally become a police officer like you’ve always wanted.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.600
Apart from becoming a police officer,

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.200
there’s one more thing that I’ve always wanted to do.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.520
But I don’t know if I’d be able to make it happen.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.880
Yes, sweetie. I’m going to turn in. I’m so exhausted.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.680
Okay. I’ll give you a call tomorrow.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.720
- Hey, careful.
- Bye Bye. Sweet dream.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.880
Careful. Easy there.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.280
Geez, what are you doing?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.840
Are you playing game? Sorry, babe.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.560
What are you looking at?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.040
I was just looking around.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.920
I don’t think so.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.640
Hey, who is this girl you’re drawing?

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.960
She looks so much like Tharn.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.960
- Let me see.
- Look.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.360
- Shit! It’s the same.
- Wow, it’s the same.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.720
Look, Tharn. She looks exactly like you.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.400
- Let me see.
- Oh.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.240
Wow

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.080
- She’s beautiful.
- They look the same.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.600
- Exactly.
- It’d be good to look this nice with my hair long.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.360
Wansarut?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.400
Let me see.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.640
Hey!

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.160
I still haven’t seen it.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.160
Booooo.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.120
What’s wrong with him?

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.160
Wansarut? If she has a name, that means she exists.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.480
Hold on, Wansarut?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.000
Wansa.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.840
Why is her name similar to Tharn’s?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.480
What?

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.760
She also looks like him.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.000
The name is quite similar too.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.880
Do you like Tharn?

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.320
Awww.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480
Is your name Wansa?

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.640
Yes.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.360
Awww.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.640
You like him so much that you even draw his picture.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.920
Seriously, why did you draw a picture of him?

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.440
Why do I have to tell you guys anything? It’s personal.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.880
Awww, personal? I see.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.560
This should be the talk of the town.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.920
(Whistle sound)

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.880
Go to bed!

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600
Wait for me.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.040
You won’t get away that easily.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.160
Phaya.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.120
Phaya would probably have a wet dream tonight.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.400
Geez, just quit it.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.480
Maybe he really likes you. That’s why he drew that girl who looks so much like you.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:28.440
You and him were probably soul mates in the past life.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.560
I knew it. It all began from the incident that day.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.720
(Car horn sound)

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.720
Let’s go.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.880
Woohoo! We’re finally here.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.000
Off you go.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.040
I think it’s that way, Tharn.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.200
Let’s get something to eat. It’s over 2 hours before the car will arrive.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.440
Okay.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:17.240
Hi, babe. We’ve just arrived. I haven’t laid my eyes on any girls, trust me. I’m with Tharn.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.640
Do you want to speak with him?

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.880
Tharn, go and find something to eat first.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.960
I have a hunch that someone might get into trouble before we become a police officer.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.960
Just go.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.760
Hello, sweety. No, I swear I didn’t look at anyone.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.720
Oh, there’s no signal here.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.920
Babe, the signal is really bad here.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.680
Can I have Stir-fried Pork with Holy Basil but without basil leaves and chilli please?

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.040
Oh, no MSG too. And only add half a spoon of salt and sugar. No cooking oil.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.920
No long beans, carrot, or any mushrooms.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.840
If you’re going to have it like that, why don’t you just cook it yourself?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.000
Every single year, I have to deal with those pain-in-the-ass PTO like you.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.840
I guess this year it’s you guys then.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.120
Here, just write it down, you rascals.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.400
Excuse me? Is there a table for one?

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.240
Open your eyes and look around. If you can’t wait, then go eat somewhere else.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.920
Go find some place to sit down or else you’d get in the way of the food riders.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.920
Um, you can sit with me if you don’t mind.
- quick

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.560
Are you done? So that I can take the order from other tables. Make it quick.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.080
Hurry up. Other people are waiting. They are hungry too.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.000
You rascals are so annoying.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.720
Here you go. Just write down whatever you want to eat.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.840
Be good though. Don’t be a pain like those rascals.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.640
Ma’am, is Order no.138 ready?

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.400
Just a second. I’m going to do it now.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.160
Why is it so busy today?

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.840
Auntie, can I order something to drink?

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:15.480
Hey, lower your voice. Can’t you see that drinks are self-service?

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.960
- So stupid.
- He’s probably blind.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.160
Or can’t read.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.840
There’s an update on a murder case where the victim was found dead with his hands and feet bound.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.840
The victim is a male Caucasian with the age of around 30 years old.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:38.600
He was found dead with his hands and feet bound. The police suspect that he was killed…

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.760
…before his body was hung up in this area of the woods.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:47.080
The police are now gathering witnesses and evidence for the special investigation unit…

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.720
…to track down the killer behind this brutal murder.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.800
- Oops!
- Hey!

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.360
- I’m so sorry.
- It’s all right.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.440
He probably wanted to know whether his jacket is waterproof or not.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.720
Why did you do that?

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.560
Why did I do what?

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.360
You stuck out your foot and made me tripped.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.320
Do you have any evidence?

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.120
I can sue you for falsely accusing me.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.160
Sue me my foot.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.840
Did you just push me?

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.120
- Eat this.
- Hey!

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.160
Fuck off.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.480
Ouch!

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.560
Damn you.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.280
Hey!

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.080
Ouch.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.840
Hey!

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.520
Let’s go.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:14.840
Go!

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.640
My shop is ruined, you rascals!

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.080
Scumbags! Why did it have to be at my shop?!

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.840
I have a hunch that my little brother is about to fall in love.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.360
Ouchhhh.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.600
You guys seem to be destined for each other.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.200
Let’s ask the abbot to look at your birthdate tomorrow, shall we?

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.960
- Just go to sleep.
- Ouch. You rascal.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.000
Guys.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.040
The instructor told me that Chart is all right now.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.760
He’s coming to pack his things today.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.960
Too bad he has to leave the training.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.160
He’s quite skillful.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.640
He’d have been a great asset to our police force.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.400
He isn’t only skillful but also pretty nasty.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.880
I agree.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.160
Yeah.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960
Let him be.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.960
Just chuck it. We’re here to train so there must be those who pass and fail.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.760
Yeah, chuck it.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.480
I think…

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.320
There’s something more interesting.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.120
Tharn

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.400
Do you want to know more about the picture that Phaya drew?

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.320
Do you want to know where he got the idea from?

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.080
Hey.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.440
Aha

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.280
- Hey.
- What?

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.160
Let’s throw him into the sea.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.360
- Okay.
- I’ll take the arms.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.960
- I’m in.
- Me too.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440
Shhh!

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.640
(Stretching)

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.440
It’s so hot.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.960
What are you guys up to?

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.960
(Stretching)

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.880
(Stretching)

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.080
Let’s go!

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.400
What the hell are you doing?! Let me go!

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.800
- Yai! Let me go!
- Yai!

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.840
Let me go!

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.960
- Stop it!
- What the fuck’s wrong with you?!

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.600
- Go, go!
- Let him go!

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.440
- Let’s throw him!
- Let me go!

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.640
- Let’s go!
- Stop!

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.960
Stop it!

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.840
Yai, let me go!

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.080
-Then you have to tell Tharn where you got the idea for that picture you drew.
- Yeah.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.960
That’s right.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.640
I have nothing to do with this.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.560
- Let him go right now, Yai.
- Fine! Just get off me!

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.680
- Get off me!
- Okay.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.760
- You got what you asked for.
- Let’s go.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.400
(Laughing sound)

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.720
What the fuck?!

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.640
Awww.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.840
What’s wrong with you guys?!

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.320
Guys…

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.840
Is that a corpse?

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.400
Shit!

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.440
Don’t touch it.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.400
Have you informed the authority?

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.640
Call the authority.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.280
Are you sure? I don’t think so.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.600
Yai, what’s wrong?

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.680
I know the identity of that corpse.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.360
Who is it?

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.400
Lieutenant Tam.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.000
Really?

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:15.320
Didn’t he take leave to visit home in Phuket since last week?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.840
Dio you know how he died?

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.200
I’ve known it for quite some time. I’m about to tell you guys too.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.200
- Eww, Khem!
- Oops! Sorry.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.880
Go and finish your business first!

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.040
Geez.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:37.320
(Flushing sound)

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.400
I overheard Captain Akk and the instructors talking that it’s a suicide.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.040
When they informed his wife, she said she found a suicide note there.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.680
It said that he was stressed because he couldn’t pay back the gambling debt. So, he killed himself.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.800
Lieutenant Tam had a gambling debt?

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.120
That’s weird.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.520
Why did he have to come all the way to the camp kill himself here?

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.960
Stop chatting

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.200
and get ready for the class!

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.120
Later then.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.800
- Let’s go.
- Yes, sir.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.040
From now on, the training will be divided into 2 parts.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.560
In the morning, you’ll learn some techniques and skills in fighting, and how to use special weapons.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.320
You’ll also have to do a field investigation.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.280
In the afternoon,

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.240
you’ll learn the theory of special investigation.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.040
The whole training program will take 200 hours.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.720
There’ll be an exam to evaluate your performance at the end of the training.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.040
I want you all to pay attention and do your best.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:41.080
Your score will affect your chance to be on the special investigation unit.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.240
We’d only take 5 of you this year.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.600
Yes?

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.200
What about those who couldn’t pass the exam?

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.920
They’ll be allocated to other units.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.360
Any questions?

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.400
Yes?

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.520
I have doubts about Lieutenant Tams’ death.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.800
Do you really believe that he killed himself?

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.600
What makes you think he didn’t?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.480
I think it doesn’t make sense.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.520
You can’t rely on your feelings during the investigation.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.560
You need evidence.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.720
Find the evidence to confirm or contradict your feelings.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.520
Okay

00:52:54.600 --> 00:53:00.560
I’ll find the evidence to confirm whether he killed himself or not.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.600
Phaya.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.800
Wait up

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.000
I want to talk about what happened this morning.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.080
Which one?

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.160
The one where Yai threw me into the sea, or the one where you stole a kiss from me.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:06.560
I didn’t kiss you. It was an accident.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.920
Do you really think I want to kiss you so badly?

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.960
Hey!

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.600
Why didn’t you tell me you’d stop?

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.360
My butt hurts because of you.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.640
Do you want me to help carry you back? Looks like it really hurts.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.120
Come on.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.600
I can walk by myself.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.000
You’re such an ass!

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.680
You know what? When you’re whining like a kid like this…

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.720
you actually look cute somehow.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.640
Cute my foot.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.000
I don’t give a damn if you’re angry with me because of what happened this morning.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.760
I forgave you since when you stole my kiss

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.040
Hey!

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.280
Asshole.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.120
Where are you going, Phaya?

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.240
Hey!

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.560
Hey!

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.320
Wait up!

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.240
Hey, stop stop!

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.880
Why are you in a hurry? Where are you going?

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.560
Tharn.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.240
We’re going to celebrate surviving the training from hell tonight. Do you want to join us?

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.520
Do you want to join us?

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.920
Yeah. Are there boozes too? I want to drink.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.800
You? You want to drink?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.640
Wow

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.040
Why? Did you have a quarrel with someone?

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.360
I had a quarrel with a jellyfish. It stung me by getting on my nerve.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.040
Hey, what the heck? What’s wrong?

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.800
Whom did you quarrel with? Just tell me.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.800
How can you quarrel with a jellyfish? Do you think he’s nuts?

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.640
The one who’s nuts is you. How can you believe what he said?

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.280
- Is there a brain in there?
- Ouch.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.160
It hurst as if I was stung by the jellyfish.

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.000
How do you know? Have you ever got stung by a jellyfish?

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.560
No, but I have tasted it. Boo!

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.080
Boo, my foot.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.680
Why do you have to be so serious?

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.840
You’re starting to like me again, aren’t you?

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.400
Stop fooling around.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.800
I can’t because my life is like a fool.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.040
Baby, wait for me.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.880
Shrimps, shells, crabs…where’s fish?

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.760
Squid?

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.000
Look how he smells them.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.320
Thank you!

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.800
Just sit down!

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:02.440
I was wondering why Sergeant granted us permission to come out.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.480
It’s actually because he wants us to eat at his wife’s restaurant.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.040
Shhh! Keep your voice down.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.720
Yai, take care of him.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.640
- Got it, Sergeant.
- Just smack him in the head.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.200
Hang on. Let me do it.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.640
- Yai
- Just smack him in the head.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.320
Hang on. Let me do it.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.960
- Okay then.
- Please enjoy your meal.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.040
Why are you bickering? How nice it is that we can get out of the camp tonight?

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.040
Okay, guys. Cheers!

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.160
For the survivors of the training from hell!

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.440
Let’s stand up!

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.760
Cheers!

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.280
- I’m all wet.
- Ahh, feeling so fresh.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.480
This is what I call life.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.400
By the way, where is Phaya? Didn’t we invite him too?

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.360
- We did. We invited everyone.
- I already told him.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.440
He was playing hard to get. Leave him be.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.720
- Baby, do you want to eat anything? I’ll get it for you.
- No need.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.200
Can I ask you guys something? Are you two broken up?

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.720
- No.
- Yes.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.000
Huh?

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.400
So, what is it? Are you guys still together?

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.680
Of course not. I was so tired while we were still together.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.600
Tired of getting hurt because I was cheated.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.560
If you know anyone who is single, please recommend him to me.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.760
Okay.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.600
Maybe I might not want to stay single any more.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.840
Don’t listen to him, Yai. Forget it.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.560
- What’s that?
- Baby, don’t be like this.

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:43.360
Tharn is my type too. But I’m not sure if you’re still single.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.600
My bro is not only single. He’s a virgin too.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.240
He’s never done it with anyone before.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.040
Really? You’ve only done it with your hands, right?

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.840
Hey,

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.600
watch your mouth.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.280
Ouch, baby.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.560
Are you really single? Why?

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.720
I haven’t met the right one yet.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.160
I like being alone too.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:16.480
It’s okay, bro. Don’t look so sad. You’re having it quite bad, huh?

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.320
Let’s not talk about love.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.320
Let’s talk about something else.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.480
He’s quite unlucky in love.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.920
As if he were cursed.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.240
It’s you who have cursed me.

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.080
I was just kidding.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.320
- Hey.
- Where’re you going?

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.320
I was just pulling your leg. Are you really going to leave?

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.200
I’m going to wee.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.880
Let’s drink to that then.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.720
- Down in, Thongthai.
- Yeah.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.360
Okay.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.040
Geez, what’s wrong with the zipper?

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.000
Let me help you.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.000
What the fuck are you doing?

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.040
If you don’t need my help then do you want me to zip it back down?

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.680
- my help then do you want me to zip it back down?
- No.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.720
What took you so long?

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.320
I’ve been here for a while. I went smoking outside.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.040
Is it true that you are still single?

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.120
Why are you interested?

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.840
I didn’t at first.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.160
But when I found out that you’re still single, you suddenly become interesting to me.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.680
(Tharn’s thought: What are you saying, Phaya?)

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.760
(Tharn’s thought: Stop looking at me like that.)

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.200
(Tharn’s thought: And why am I blushing?)

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.360
Why are you interested in me?

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.800
Well, I just wonder…

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.480
that you’re quite grown up but still single and virgin too.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.800
I never know that a virgin would look like this.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.000
Hey!

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.400
Asshole!

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.840
You evil nasty jellyfish!

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.520
I’ve got a lot queuing up for me. I just don’t want to be with them.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Damn it!

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.320
What’s up, guys?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.320
Phaya, where have you been?

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.080
I just went to the loo.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:15.920
Cheers!

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.880
- You’re late. I’m so drunk already.
- Cheers!

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.840
Serg! Bravo!

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.600
Awesome, Serg!

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.680
- He’s so drunk.
- Serg! Hey, hey, hey…

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.200
Khem!

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.920
- Khem!
- Yai, look at him.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.120
Khem!
- Yai, get him back here.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.880
You guys, come out and dance with me.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.720
Geez!

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.640
Yai, get him back here.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.760
Geez,

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.640
he’s so drunk.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.800
- Go back to your table.
- Oh, come on.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.480
Go sit down.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.560
Hey, cheers.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.560
Okay.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.520
Come on, Yai.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.640
- You’re too loud.
- Just sit down.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.280
- Sit down, Khem.
- Sit down.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.720
Let’s play a game.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.840
- What game?
- Clear the table.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.600
- Move that away.
- What game?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.800
It’s called ‘Spin the Bottle’ game.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.040
Spin the bottle?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.000
If the bottle points towards anyone,

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.840
that person must answer the question asked by the others.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.120
If that person refuses to answer,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.840
he must down the glass.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.800
Down it?

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.760
- Got it?
- Okay, let’s play.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.440
- Bring it on.
- Yeah.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.840
First, let’s fill up your glass.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.960
What? Again?

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.360
- Fill up his glass too.
- You go first.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.440
Now, we’re all even.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.360
You’re so wasted, Khem.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.520
Come, come.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.000
Tharn.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.160
Who’s going to ask?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.440
Khem, you ask him.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:17.440
Do you like anyone in this table?

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.920
- Answer me.
- Answer, answer, answer!

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.080
Oh, come on.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.200
Then you spin it.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.240
- Down it.
- Spin it.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.280
Spin it, Tharn.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.120
- Oh, Yai.
- It’s your turn.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.560
Why me?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.560
- I’ll ask you.
- Okay.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.480
What is he like when he’s drunk?

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.800
Why are you laughing?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.120
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.640
- I don’t want to imagine it.
- You know?

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.360
I just went out with him. He got drunk and jumped into the canal naked.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.200
Ohhh!

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.800
- Naked?
- Yes.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.200
Do you want to see it today?

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.240
Then, let’s get him drunk!

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.160
- Mine is empty.
- Let’s fill it up.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.360
Cheers!

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.760
It’s Yai again.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.560
Down it.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.760
Shhh! Keep it down.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.280
Are you okay?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.720
Let’s go.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.760
Let’s go.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.800
Aren’t you going to help?

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.880
He’s your brother, not mine.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:01.320
But he’s so drunk because you encouraged him to drink and play that stupid bottle game.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.640
Why are you so interested in his life?

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.520
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.160
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.960
- Phaya.
- Shhh!

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.400
Keep your voice down, Yai.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.200
Geez, is he going to be all right?

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.560
The instructor’s coming this way.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.960
Shhh!

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.600
About Lieutenant Tam’s case, what are you going to do next?

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.000
They told us to close the case and treat it as a suicide.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.640
They already took away all the forensic evidence.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.440
Tell our men to collect more data and evidence.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.920
Both around the place where the body was found, and the surrounding area.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.200
Thoroughly check all the surveillance cameras, both in land and water.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.440
Make sure you send all the data to me first.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.440
What about the request from the authority to explore the area for gathering more evidence?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:18.480
Tell them that we’d gather all the info and evidence and will forward it to them.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.400
But not right now.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:28.640
I’m going to keep it confidential first.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.720
Please gather all the data for me.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.000
Yes, Captain.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.000
I’m not going to force any of you to go with me.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.640
But if I turn a blind eye to this matter, I don’t think I’d deserve to become a cop

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.960
I’m in.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.200
If you’re in, I’ll do it too.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.640
Me too.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.640
What are they doing here?

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.319
They said they lost something at the beach,

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.000
so they want to look at the surveillance camera dated 2 days back.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.200
