00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.220
Thank you.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.240
I wish everyone a happy night tonight.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.000
I will drive you home today.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.520
You sang for my restaurant again.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.830
Especially when that guy said he had feelings for you,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.070
it made me even more irritated.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.160
Un?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.340
Un!?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.320
Huh?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.520
What?

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.930
Why are you spacing out?

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.120
Are you tired?

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.060
Huh?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.680
Do you wanna eat something?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.190
Or...

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.400
would you like to order pasta to take home?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.640
It's okay.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.240
I'd better head home.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.750
Your bag.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.980
Come on.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.540
Let's go.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.420
Shall we grab something to eat tomorrow, Un?

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.080
Un?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.000
Huh?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.740
Why?

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.420
Shall we find something delicious to eat tomorrow?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.580
I think you look stressed out these days.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.840
Thank you, Pete.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.120
But I'm okay.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.230
Thanks for taking me home.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.120
My pleasure.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.200
Can I be there for you from now on?

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.530
I have loved you for a long time.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.070
Will you give me a chance?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.210
Thank you.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.880
In the past,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.060
you have always been my good friend.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.640
But I still don't fully understand my own feelings,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.360
I'm not sure if I'd just be wasting your time.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.600
I'm good.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.230
Give me the answer when you are ready.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.220
All I want is to give me a chance

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.380
not close your heart to me.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.700
Yeah.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.850
Okay.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.100
So cute.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.760
I'm leaving now.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.880
Good night, Un In.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.520
Your bag.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.280
I'll go now.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.680
Bye bye.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.250
See you.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.420
How are you here?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.280
I'm here to talk business with a development project nearby.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.730
I didn't mean to wait around for you

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.180
or bother you.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.230
Oh.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.080
Okay.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.020
This Sunday,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.540
can you go out with me?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.490
Sorry, I can't.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.680
Hold on, Un.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.670
Just one last chance.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.950
After that, I won't bother you again.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.800
If we're still together,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.910
this Sunday will be our 7th anniversary.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.320
We broke up a long time ago.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.000
Please stop counting

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280
and stop thinking about me.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.340
Please, Un.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.940
I promise I won't bother you again.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.850
Please give me a chance to do...

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.640
Fine.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.620
I've agreed,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.740
so now you can go back, right?

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.100
Thank you.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.100
I will pick you up this Sunday.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.610
[Timethai Craft & Cafe]

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.610
Do you like this place?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.220
I really like it.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.740
I've wanted to try this for a long time.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.620
How'd you find this place?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.420
Since you said you wanted to try this,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.660
I've checked out several places.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.060
But I think you like this place the most.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.500
It's a shame

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.120
I didn't bring you here sooner.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.240
It's okay,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.240
we're here now anyway.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.030
Let's go check that out.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.500
How about this one, Heart?

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.940
It's cute.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.680
But there is a bigger one.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.070
Which one?

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.560
This one.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.310
So that you have plenty of space to color.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.090
I want to spend a long time with you.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.320
Should I take this one?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.200
Is this one okay?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.600
A big brush is okay.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.920
You should use both a big and a small brush.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.840
Stop being naughty for a moment.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.840
Look, it's all dirty.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.400
I'll wipe it off for you.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.840
I'm about to turn 26.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.600
I'm not a kid anymore, Heart.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.080
How could you say naughty to me?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.620
You can.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.480
Look, it's just like you when you were 18.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.720
Thank you.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.770
There are insects there.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.900
Isn't this my hair clip?

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.820
I've been looking for it for a long time.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.690
My hair clip is with you.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.120
You forgot it in the room.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.820
I carry it

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.400
as a charm

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.900
to comfort me.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.820
I will continue painting.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.710
I'll be back.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.370
Yeah.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.160
So pretty.

Huh?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.050
It's getting late.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.280
Should we stop by a restaurant before we go home?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.720
My secretary told me there's a good pasta restaurant around here.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.880
I want to take you there.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.800
Restaurant?

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.050
I know

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.290
you don't really like eating at restaurants.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.300
But I just want to have a meal with you.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.200
Actually,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.760
I would like to cook for you myself.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.150
But you wouldn't like it

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.120
if you had to eat in our room.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.550
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.770
Okay.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.290
Then...

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.290
should I buy you something to eat before we go back?

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.080
Heart.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.880
It's not that I don't like restaurants.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.800
But I'm afraid you have a food allergy.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.710
I don't want to eat with anxiety.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.880
Especially, it's a pasta restaurant.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.160
I'm worried you'll just watch me eat.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.410
Just looking at you

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200
makes me happy.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.980
No way.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.320
It will make me nervous.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.580
Okay, then...

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.270
Wait for me at the car, Un.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.890
I'll follow you later.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.700
Hold on, Heart.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.870
Do you need anything else?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.840
How about...

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.500
cooking in my room

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.030
instead?

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.210
Sure.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.600
Then I'll stop by the supermarket on the way back.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.760
Okay.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.080
You can put it here.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.140
Right here.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.140
What dish will you cook?

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.510
I'll help you.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.410
I will cook for you today.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.340
You really don't need my help?

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.760
Just sit and cheer me on.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.950
Un, it's almost time in 15 minutes.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.440
Are you ready? Are you excited?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.420
A little bit.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.420
I'm worried that I'll get so excited that I'll sing off-key.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.350
Don't be nervous. You can do it.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.670
Follow me after you're ready.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.500
Thank you.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.579
[I have something to do. I can't go see you sing]

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.809
[See you at the room. I'll be right back after I'm done]

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.970
[Keep fighting. My Un is the best]

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.840
He must be busy with important work.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.260
You can do it!

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.620
Un In, keep fighting!

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.730
You can order another drink, Ann.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720
I'm good.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.200
I have an early flight tomorrow.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.679
Don't you have something important you need to go to?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.120
You're busy with your phone.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.140
No.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.880
I'm watching Un live singing.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.050
But it hasn't started yet.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.800
You can order more.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.340
This restaurant has a great vibe and I know the chef here.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:15.450
[Revealed! Posh Ann, the Woman by Investor Heart Haran's Side, Caught Dining Together]

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.600
How was your day, my love?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.380
Sorry I didn't get to see you sing.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.480
So…

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.030
do you have a video?

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.880
What you need to do

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.300
is have dinner with her, right?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.180
You're misunderstanding me, Un.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.340
She is Ann.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.080
The partner I told you about.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.680
You guys seem so close.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.440
We have been working together for a long time.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.520
Also,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.220
Ann is heading abroad tomorrow to take charge of the project.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.530
I just

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.500
had a farewell for her.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.520
That's all, Un.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.410
Why don't you tell me honestly?

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.380
Why do you have to hide it from me if it's such a small matter?

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.580
Because I know you will be uncomfortable.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.450
You know I'll be uncomfortable.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.260
So you chose to hide it from me instead, right?

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.720
It's not what you think.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.640
I see this as my final farewell to her.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.660
If she were still around,

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.450
would you still secretly go see her behind my back?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.910
You've got me all wrong.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.790
In the past,

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.140
no matter how long you kept me waiting,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:20.680
I always waited.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I understand that you are busy with work.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.660
But today...

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.610
My first show.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.270
On our anniversary.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.910
It's less important than a farewell for your partner.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.800
Un.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.490
I'm sorry.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.900
I promise I won't miss watching you sing next time.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.410
How many times have you said that?

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.050
Enough.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.330
It's just singing, Un.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.280
Heart I know would never say that.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.010
Un.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.270
I'm sorry.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.160
I didn't mean it like that.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.130
In the past,

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.770
I always asked myself

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.500
why our relationship turned out this way.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.120
Since the day you became vice president,

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.010
I never felt I deserved to be by your side.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.840
I try to understand that you are busy.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.890
But am I not important to you at all?

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.540
You are important, Un.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.720
Don't cry, Un.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.450
I'm sorry.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.980
I love you so much, Un.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.720
Love?

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.340
You forgot our anniversary last year,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.350
and today you forgot it again.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.660
Do you know

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.750
how long I've been waiting for this day?

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.760
The day I can show you that I'm a singer.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.460
The day I was proud of my talent.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.580
The day I made my dream come true.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.930
The day I can stand beside you without shame.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.580
But I was wrong.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.970
It's my fault for thinking I can stand by you.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.680
No, Un. Don't cry.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.490
I'm sorry.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.160
I promise I will improve myself, Un.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.100
How about this?

That's enough, Heart.

Let's start over, Un.

Let's stop here.

If we continue to force ourselves to be together,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.540
it will only make our love fade.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.190
I don't want us to reach a point where we hate one another.

From now on,

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.840
Did I cook it badly?

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.500
Why didn't you eat more of it?

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.880
So tasty.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.340
Really?

I'm afraid it won't be tasty.
