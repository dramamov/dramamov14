00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.080
What's wrong?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.560
Are you feeling unwell again?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.680
I'll go get the doctor.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.160
No.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.320
Don't be so nervous.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
How can I not be nervous?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.479
After all, from this moment on,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.120
you're my boyfriend now.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.480
It's time for the recording.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480
Come out quickly.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.639
Go ahead.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
I'm going then,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.320
boyfriend.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800
I'll call you,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.880
boyfriend.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.240
Okay.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.560
You need to follow the doctor's orders.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.520
Understand?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.600
I understand.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.840
Fri-

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.600
end.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680
You should go now.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.320
What's wrong?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960
Don't look like you're brain-dead,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.400
okay?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.060
Your smile is creeping me out.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.880
Okay.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.200
Let me remind you,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.160
Mr. Shen's condition is quite serious.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.130
Do you know that?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.370
Then why are you still with him?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.520
I know he's sick.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.600
I've tried to keep my distance,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.760
but I can't do it.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.440
Because

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.600
I truly like him.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.840
Enough.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.320
Ni Hao is my son.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680
He has nothing to do with you.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040
Don't buy him toys secretly anymore

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.460
or take him out to play.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.200
You've been busy lately,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.330
haven't even had time to watch my show.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.060
I'll be going then.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.839
Take care.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.120
Hey.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.080
You startled me.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.280
You didn't win any award,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.400
why are you so happy?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860
Something good happened?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.920
Not telling you.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.920
There's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.159
a scent of gossip coming from you.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.800
Sweet and juicy.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.920
You're in love.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.280
If you gossip about me again,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.880
I'll rip your tongue out.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.640
Is there really no gossip?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.920
Sorry,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.080
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.410
Please try again later.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.400
Why did you come back suddenly?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.730
Weren't you out of town?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760
I missed you,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.640
so I came back early.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640
So, are you surprised?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.600
Very surprised!

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.440
By the way,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.159
I learned how to make your favorite fish-flavored eggplant today.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.760
Let's try.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.450
Let's go.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.840
Go.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.060
Do you need something?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.840
If it's about Ni Hao,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.660
then don't bother.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360
Your right foot is bigger than your left.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.320
When buying shoes, you should get one size larger

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.920
so your right foot fits properly.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.440
You need a ball-of-foot pad for your left foot.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.500
Ill-fitting shoes

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.320
will definitely cause you to twist your ankle.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.080
Um,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.200
I bought some medicine. It'll be here soon.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.260
You came here today

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.159
to tell me something?

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.640
I want to say

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.100
Although I'm not Ni Hao's father,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.160
but I...

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.970
we can still be friends, right?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.400
Of course.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.570
Friendship lasts forever, after all.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.320
Good evening.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.760
Mr. Cheng, visiting so late,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.159
is there something you need?

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.120
Nothing special.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.600
Just...

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.200
visiting her boss on Zheng Ying's behalf.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.880
In what capacity

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.040
are you representing Zheng Ying?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.640
Why are you asking something you already know?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.000
My relationship with Zheng Ying,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.600
don't you understand it by now?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.520
All I can say is

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.240
my relationship with Zheng Ying...

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.300
No need to explain.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.400
I understand.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.800
I understand perfectly.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.340
Boss and employee, right?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.560
I don't think you understand at all.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.680
I do. I understand completely.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.460
So given our connection through Zheng Ying,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.000
I think from now on,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.600
we should stop being adversaries.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.400
After all, we'll be family soon,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.040
right?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.800
Whatever happened in the past,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.200
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.400
I forgive you.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.040
From now on,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.160
you

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.120
and I

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.520
are good friends.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.570
I'm leaving.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.240
Morning, my boyfriend.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.000
What are you doing?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520
Handling work for a certain artist.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.520
Today is our first day as a couple.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.880
Why aren't you excited at all?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.920
We don't seem like a couple in love at all.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.700
Shouldn't couples be together all the time?

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.200
The essence of a relationship

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.530
is like a cooperative economic activity.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.880
The most important thing is collaboration of value.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.560
Only then can we

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.420
maximize benefits for both of us.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.400
Besides,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.120
you're in your rising phase now.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.960
I want you to keep working toward your goals,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.520
not get lost in romance.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.610
Understand?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.060
Everyone does their part.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.440
Division of labor.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.480
That doesn't sound like a couple at all.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.760
More like comrades.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.600
But

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.800
I just really want to see you.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.320
I have to go now.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.580
Someone's at the door.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.800
Why are you here?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.400
I'm pursuing maximum profit.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.880
Didn't you say we're comrades?

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.620
You can do it, Ying!

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.880
Go, Ying!

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.280
Ying, you're amazing!

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.170
Awesome!

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.920
Almost there.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.000
It seems that following Mr. Shen's advice

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.520
and adjusting Zheng Ying's script promptly

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.200
has really improved the results.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.760
Look.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.800
Ying, let me help you.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.850
Let me carry something for you.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.960
I think there's a problem here.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.440
Where's your script?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.560
Use mine.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.680
Look at the script.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.760
Why are you looking at me?

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.820
There are no words written on my face.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.600
Here.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.480
This part.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.840
I'll try my best to talk to the production team.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.340
Don't move.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.240
Open your eyes wider.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.040
Oh, right.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.760
I made some new

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.480
snacks that suit your taste.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.920
There are dried bananas, raisins, and dried strawberries.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.520
This is my first time making

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.080
snacks with normal flavors.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.680
It's not challenging at all.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.600
Why a magpie?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.520
It's a secret.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.170
Be careful on your way back.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.960
So silly.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.730
Let's go.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.040
Okay.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.400
Good, stop.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.880
Very good.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.000
All departments are fine.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.960
Take a break.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.520
Hello.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.480
Hi.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.360
Are you here for coffee?

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.320
No.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.720
Can I take a photo with you?

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.400
A photo?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.320
With me?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.600
Yes, I'm your fan.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.800
A fan?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.520
Oh my god.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.980
This is the first time I've met a real fan.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.680
Sure, we can take a photo.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.360
I'm your fan too.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.280
Me too.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.840
I...

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.800
Am I famous now?

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.360
Of course.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.680
Your speech at the awards ceremony was so captivating.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.160
'The Duel of Beauties' premieres today.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.120
We'll go to the theater to support you.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.000
Thank you.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.640
Thanks.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.700
Could you sign this for me? Thank you.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.300
This is my first time signing an autograph for someone.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.760
We'd like your autograph too.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760
I want one as well.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.600
Let's take a photo together.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.040
Thank you.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.500
Can we take a picture together? Is that okay?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.360
Thanks.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.720
Mr. Shen

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.680
Today 'The Duel of Beauties' officially premieres.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.360
First,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.360
as soon as the first screening ends,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.600
we'll release twenty articles

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.440
praising Zheng Ying's acting skills.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.840
What's next?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.770
Don't release any articles about her acting skills.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.080
She recently

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.840
trended because of the awards ceremony.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.200
Her popularity is already high.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.120
If we release more articles,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.120
it will only cause public backlash.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.620
Remember this.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.040
Acting skills

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.200
need to be recognized by the audience.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.000
We need to get genuine feedback.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.200
But are we doing nothing at all?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.530
What we need to do now

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.680
is to fully cooperate with

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.610
the producer's promotional plan.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.260
Our current work focus

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.320
should remain on 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.640
In the days ahead,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.160
I'll work harder and never give up.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.240
I believe.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.880
What's mine is mine.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.200
Mr. Shen,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.940
the big boss sent another surgical plan.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.640
Should we ignore it and delete it again?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:53.960
So you're the one

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.820
who's making my brother suffer so much, Zhengying.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.240
It's already 2023

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.720
and we're still seeing these outdated plot lines.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.680
Don't tell me the next line will be...

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.940
I'll give you 5 million

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.420
to leave my brother alone.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080
The lines are exactly like in a TV drama.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:26.960
Mr. Shen,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.220
this bank card of yours...

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680
I can't accept it.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.770
What do you mean?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.400
If I'm not mistaken,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.360
this is a bank card under your own name.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.520
If you give this to me,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.800
you could just go to the bank to report it lost

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.080
or go to the police afterward.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.140
If they charge me with something like

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.400
robbery or extortion,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.060
I'd be in serious trouble.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160
How about this?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.250
What do you want?

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.600
You sign a gift contract with me,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.160
and pay the gift tax for me as well.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.369
What's going on?

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.970
Could you help me

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.609
make an appointment with that doctor?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.280
You...

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.440
you agreed?

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.079
That's great! That's great!

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.119
I'll arrange it right away. I'll arrange it right away.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.280
Wait for me. Wait for me.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.340
That's wonderful.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.600
But...

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.680
why did he suddenly agree?

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.560
For me to approve your relationship

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.920
is not impossible.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.320
Above are the things Yifan must pay attention to

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.560
in daily life.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.690
You better remember them well.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.520
Otherwise,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.800
the contract states that

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.000
you must cooperate with Party A,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.960
which is me,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.460
to film any content I specify.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.960
Hello?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.400
Hi.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.900
What are you doing?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.840
Nothing much.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.480
I just

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.920
met someone interesting.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.240
Really?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.480
I

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.440
miss you a little.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.840
I miss you too.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.330
You've only been gone for two days and I already miss you.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.760
There's not much to shoot tonight.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.280
So...

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.680
Can I go see him

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.610
secretly after I finish shooting?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.480
Recently

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.200
Zheng Ying caused some trouble for the production team.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.680
Go prepare a support vehicle.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.810
We'll head over now.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.400
That happened so long ago.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.520
Isn't it too late to go now?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.040
And you have three meetings this afternoon.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.700
The three meetings can be combined and moved up.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.360
Wu Yu.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.520
You know what?

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.280
Before today,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.360
I felt that living

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.320
was just getting closer to death each day.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320
But from now on,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.880
I want every day of my life

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.400
to be filled with hope.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.320
Do as I say.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520
Mr. Shen.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.040
Although I want you to be happy,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.920
is this really okay?

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.160
Director.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.200
Mr. Shen.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.240
Hurry up! Make way!

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.160
Here, Mr. Shen, please have a seat.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:39.760
Thank you.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.240
Director.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.840
This is the coffee Mr. Shen brought for you.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.800
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.760
You're too kind.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.360
Always bringing gifts when you visit.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.920
Mr. Shen,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.520
the show hasn't started recording yet.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.760
If you want to listen later, put on the headphones.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.120
Okay.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.720
I've heard that

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.730
you asked Brother Youyi to pick you up.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.090
What are you really doing tonight?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.520
Your habit of eavesdropping,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.120
when will you ever change it?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.960
I was just passing by.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.280
When have you not been 'just passing by'?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.540
When was it ever actually coincidental?

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.880
If you keep this up,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.690
I'll have your head separated from your body.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.760
Is this how you treat the male lead of your next show?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.800
If I die,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.160
you'll be a widow with a living husband.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.120
Tell Yu Youyi he doesn't need to come anymore.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.480
Okay.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.800
Mr. Shen.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.900
To create authenticity for the show,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.660
therefore,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.080
what's about to happen

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.600
hasn't been told to the actors.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600
They have no idea,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.500
so please help us keep it a secret.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.080
So,

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.090
what's going to happen?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.120
I didn't expect you to be so busy

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.120
and still have time to watch movies.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.100
It's my own work after all.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.810
I have to make time to see it.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.680
Still keeping the habit

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.540
of staying until the end credits.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.240
The creation of a work

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.760
involves not just the actors on screen,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.960
but also the hard work of the crew behind the scenes

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.220
and their dedication.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.050
Would you like to

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.330
find a place to sit down for a while?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.440
Run!

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.840
Don't let her get away!

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.680
Don't catch me!

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.810
Where are you going?

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.720
Don't grab me!

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.360
It's me,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.720
Shen Yifan.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.280
They're still filming. Stay in character.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.810
Let's go.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.760
Stop him! Quick!

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.960
Is your heart okay after running like that?

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.850
I'm fine.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.000
They're still filming.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.320
Should we go back?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:32.840
No need.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.250
I already spoke with the director.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:35.930
Let's go.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.770
Want to go in and take a look?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.280
Sure.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.240
It seems

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.530
it's locked.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.560
It's okay.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.210
Let's go.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.640
Here.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.280
Thank you.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.160
I'm sorry

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.800
I couldn't find a private place.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.920
This is the only place we can go.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.640
It's fine.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.570
It was just a spontaneous suggestion anyway.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.040
This house

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.810
seems smaller than before.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.680
But the furniture and decorations are still the same.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.280
Yes.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.320
Before,

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.930
didn't you like to rehearse your scenes here?

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.970
You would read scripts on the sofa.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.980
And do yoga on the balcony.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.760
I'm sorry.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.880
I didn't mean to bring it up.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.280
Do you want to check out the balcony?

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.560
Sure.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.040
This place is still the same.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.000
What about my succulents?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.460
Well...

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.560
Look.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.650
These pothos planters are still here.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.010
And this rocking chair.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.640
Whenever I feel troubled,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.080
I feel that being here

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.680
helps calm my mind.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.680
If our memories

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.960
bring you some comfort,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.200
then that's good.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.980
Not just some comfort,

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.760
but a lot.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.920
I know

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.080
you probably think it's ridiculous

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.680
that I've been down for so long

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.480
and now I'm telling you all this.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.500
Actually, I have many too.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.240
I never thought

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.300
our relationship would be like this.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.520
Shen Yifan.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.880
Tell me,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.480
what were we doing on our 100-day anniversary?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.200
100 days?

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.160
You were probably at

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.290
the 'Drunken Jade Mountain' film set.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.520
What about that year?

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.280
Even though anniversaries are cliché,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.880
we should still follow the proper traditions.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.240
What traditions?

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.440
In the morning,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.320
I should be awakened by

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.720
the fragrance of a huge bouquet of roses.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.010
Then when I open my eyes,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.920
on my finger

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.650
there should be a super sparkly diamond ring.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.480
During the day,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.160
we'll wear our custom matching outfits

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.420
and show off in public.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.760
In the evening,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.840
we'll have dinner at the Langang Revolving Restaurant.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.360
The food there is amazing,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.200
and the night view is spectacular.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.120
After dinner,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.400
we'll find

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.460
a movie theater with massage chairs.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.320
Is that all?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.960
It's only our first year,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.560
we can't make it too perfect.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.160
We need to leave room for our third, fifth, and tenth years

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.220
to get even better.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.200
For example,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.000
we could travel around the country

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.610
or around the world.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.450
We could climb snowy mountains

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.010
or go hiking in forests.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.760
Do you not like my plans

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.180
or are you worried about your health?

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.520
I...

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.960
You know what?

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.520
I've had magical powers since I was little.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.320
Especially these hands of mine.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.080
Anyone whose hand I hold

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.480
will be very lucky.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.080
Look.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.360
I told you we're lucky.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.220
Come quick.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.770
Who's there?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.050
They won't let us in.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.620
I didn't expect there would be NPCs here too.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.800
This should be

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.600
our fourth kiss.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.280
No.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.380
It's the fifth.
