WEBVTT

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.180
Let's move.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.900
Is that necessary?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800
The video of your confrontation with Chengdong

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.080
has already topped three trending topics.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.280
Plus his apology video

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.410
topped another two.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.479
You're making history here.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's go, superstar.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.479
Zheng Ying is coming out!

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.280
Miss Zheng,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.060
could you say a few words to us?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.320
Excuse us,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.920
thank you.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.080
Miss Zheng!

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.160
Stop taking sneaky photos from that tree!

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.290
Stop taking photos!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.780
What are you doing?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.960
Do you know how much one of your

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.490
leaked set photos is worth?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.210
Good. Look to your right, Miss.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.680
Good.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:50.880
Let's take a break, Miss.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.560
Thank you.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.130
Have some water.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.080
Thank you for your hard work today.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.640
Thank you.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.280
It's my duty.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.810
This way.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.920
Mr. Shen.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.570
Are you feeling better?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.600
How is she doing?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.820
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.640
The news about Chengdong's alcohol dependency

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.840
has been made public.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.920
He has already apologized.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760
This turn of events

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.680
has earned Zheng Ying a lot of public support.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.520
She's getting numerous invitations now.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.160
Tomorrow,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.200
she'll be attending

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.330
a famous charity gala in the industry.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.880
Mr. Shen.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.000
She can manage on her own now.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.410
She really doesn't need my help after all.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.200
Yes, Mr. Shen.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.200
Zheng Ying is now

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.079
a very mature and popular star.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.200
Our initial mission

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.530
has been accomplished.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.320
Mr. Shen,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240
you'll definitely get better.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.300
The doctor said...

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.480
It's okay.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.600
Don't worry.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.960
I won't give up.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.280
Just as she hoped,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.040
I must hold on until I can get the heart transplant.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.770
Mr. Shen Senior said

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.800
he'll find a way.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.570
He's probably busy.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.900
After all, he's a big shot.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.880
The line of people wanting to see him

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.880
could stretch all the way to France.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.040
I know.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.560
That's why

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.290
I haven't bothered him either.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.400
Are you ready?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.240
I'm ready.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.180
It's so beautiful.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.159
You insisted on taking extra painkillers

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.720
just to see her once?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.160
If only you were here

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.200
for occasions like this.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.120
I'm too busy.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.050
Maybe next time.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.650
Alright.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.080
Next, we have the popular actress

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.160
Zheng Ying coming to the stage

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.200
to light up

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.660
the guiding lamp of tonight's charity gala.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.760
Zheng Ying.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.290
Don't be impulsive.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.400
Times have changed.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.720
Once your relationship with Shen Yifan becomes public,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.760
you'll be labeled as

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.820
someone who didn't earn her success.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.940
All your hard work will be wasted.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.780
Go to the hospital.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.320
Why doesn't he say anything?

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.440
Mr. Shen is in this ward.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.040
I'll do as you say.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.520
Okay.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.320
Goodbye.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.920
What's wrong?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.410
Why are you in the hospital?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.800
I've

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.050
caught a cold recently.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.220
Wu Yu made a big fuss and insisted I be hospitalized.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.290
The reason I didn't come see you

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.290
I was also afraid of infecting you.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.880
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.210
Why didn't I answer?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.530
I had an important meeting.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.860
But I was afraid of missing your call.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.480
So I left my phone with him.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.410
Who knew he wouldn't answer it.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.160
The phone died.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.640
It turned off.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.000
Your salary for this month...

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.320
Don't even think about getting it.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.250
Go charge it now.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.840
Hurry up.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.200
Go now.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080
Don't be angry.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.280
Look,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.570
I've docked his pay for a month.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.090
Don't be upset anymore.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.280
Have an apple.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.160
These days,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520
I've been really worried about you.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.040
I'm sorry.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.840
Promise me,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.040
don't hide anything from me in the future.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.520
Tell me immediately.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.480
Okay?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.000
Okay.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.520
I'm Rebecca's colleague

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.780
here to do a routine check-up on Mr. Shen.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.040
You might need to wait a moment.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.320
After the injection,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.810
has Mr. Shen shown any adverse reactions?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.440
None so far.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.280
Well,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.010
it's still in clinical trials.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.010
There are many uncertainties.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.290
We need to monitor him constantly.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.000
Doctor,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.800
That medicine, can we still...

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.730
This medication

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.600
is quite controversial now.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.730
Sacrificing what little life remains

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.000
to regain

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.720
temporary mobility -

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.920
this aspect

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
has been criticized by many.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.600
Besides,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.320
Mr. Shen's physical condition

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.380
is extremely poor.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.840
Even if you could get the medication

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.280
from the Swiss pharmaceutical institute,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.080
I won't administer any more injections.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.760
Otherwise,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.020
I'm afraid he might...

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.600
I understand.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.720
Thank you.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.800
I'm perfectly fine.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.260
What are you doing?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.930
It's been half an hour and they're still not here.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.560
If the paparazzi catch this,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.220
it would cause a huge scandal.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.600
Hey.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.250
What are you doing here?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.130
You're sick.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.480
It's Ni Hao.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.240
He was carrying his camera today

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.880
and climbing up the stairs to take photos.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.360
Then he accidentally fell down.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.280
Where is he now?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.600
Dad.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.120
How could you be so careless?

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.650
Does your wound still hurt?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.640
I'm a big boy.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.640
This little injury is nothing.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.560
Dad.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.640
Look.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.000
I took these.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.360
I captured the entire

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.960
sunset process.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.440
They're really good.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.800
But next time you take photos,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.320
don't go to dangerous places, okay?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.800
Understand?

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.440
Dad.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.880
Are they really that good?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.160
Of course.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.120
I can already see

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.160
a rising star

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.480
in photography.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.380
When I become a photographer,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.160
I'll teach you how to take photos.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.960
Will you be

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.490
my photography assistant?

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.560
I'm making a renowned documentary director

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.240
serve as my assistant.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.280
That's ridiculous.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.480
Senior,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.840
stop teasing me.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.480
My win over you last time

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.680
was just a fluke.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.400
I know where I fall short.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.880
I want to learn more from you.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.240
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.400
People are saying that we

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.240
don't get along.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240
That's exactly why

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.800
I should be your assistant.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.400
But I need someone

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.720
who can endure hardship

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.980
and doesn't talk much.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.000
What a coincidence!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.880
I happen to be someone who talks very little

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.340
and can handle tough work.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.720
This is a photo I took of my mom.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.450
She looks so beautiful.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.560
Haven't you

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.280
moved on yet?

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.880
What's up, Ying?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.800
Still want me to pretend I'm Shen Yifan today?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.560
Of course.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.160
I'm staying loyal to the end.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.060
The moonlight tonight

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.570
is truly beautiful.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.400
What are you doing?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.680
No matter how beautiful the moonlight is,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.480
it can't compare to your beauty.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.690
Do you say this to every girl, General?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.880
I only say this to you.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.850
I don't believe you.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
It suits you well.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.840
A return gift.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.890
Were you waiting for me?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.420
You've got some nerve.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.010
Just passing by.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.120
But I was waiting for you.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.040
What?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.160
Will you be my wife?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.120
Wife?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.920
The fate between us

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.820
was destined from our first meeting.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.680
I cannot let you down.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.040
This dagger

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.440
has accompanied me on many battlefields for years.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.840
Today I present it to you.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.920
As a token

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.320
of our love.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.280
The role I played this time

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.560
was quite challenging,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.160
especially the action scenes.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.220
Speaking of which,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.920
I must express my gratitude.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.920
Mr. Zheng's help.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.680
No, no.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.520
Actually,

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.960
Yuchen is really dedicated.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.080
She does almost all the action scenes herself.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.760
Her talent

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.520
shouldn't be underestimated.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.280
Well, Xiaoying,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.880
what do you think about

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.720
the cartoon exposé from the 'Weekly Entertainment Blast' blogger?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720
What's your opinion?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.960
Many netizens are guessing it's about you.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.760
Do you have any response to this?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.810
Entertainment Weekly Gossip.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.560
It's about me.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.000
I told you already

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.840
to be extra careful.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.000
Don't lose your mind the moment you see each other.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
How did you still get photographed?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040
Female celebrity

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200
with mystery man.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.920
This is way too vague.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.500
Maybe they're not even talking about me.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040
A popular actress

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.690
with a double identity.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.440
Plus the poster of Zuiyu Tuishan.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.980
If it's not you,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.600
then who else could it be?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.040
Well,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.920
can we pay

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.599
to make it go away?

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.800
You think I don't want to?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.480
The problem is this Weekly Entertainment Exposé

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.200
is completely incorruptible.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.040
In his hands,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.240
there's no scandal that can be managed.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.480
Even if Shen Yifan showed up, it wouldn't help.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.760
What should we do then?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.800
We have no idea

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.400
what cards they're holding.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.920
If we deny it,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.720
we could easily be proven wrong.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.880
So,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.930
do you want to go public?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.760
Yes.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.220
Then I'll inform Yu Youyi.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.160
But I can't.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.760
You can't.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.240
It's been less than six hours since the news broke.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.960
The Rulanshi ad that was a sure thing

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.520
has now gone to someone else.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.520
And those endorsements with contracts about to expire

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.720
have also informed us

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.600
they're putting things on hold.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.660
If you reveal your relationship now,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.460
do you know how much you stand to lose?

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.160
All my hard work and achievements

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.580
will no longer be associated with me.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.840
But,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.600
I think this is all temporary.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.610
Good acting speaks for itself.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.800
My work

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.240
will prove my efforts.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.180
Brother Youyi,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.760
I believe

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.220
my relationship isn't a burden to my career.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.320
Besides,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.580
Shen Yifan has been helping me all along.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.400
I don't want to deny

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.280
my relationship with him for profit.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.880
That wouldn't be fair to him.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.380
What about Shen Yifan?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.460
Do you think he wants to go public too?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.440
He

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.280
is definitely willing too.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.210
If he's willing,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.680
then why hasn't he

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.210
given you any response yet?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.840
Maybe

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.720
he's busy

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.980
and hasn't seen it yet.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.700
I'll go ask him.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.860
No matter what,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.180
you must focus on your career.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.120
We men

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.730
are unreliable.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.280
But what if

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.280
they release solid evidence in the next few days?

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.680
Even solid evidence can be denied.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.280
Why?

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.000
Shen Yiyang,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.440
are you not planning

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.440
to get that medicine for me anymore?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.560
The doctor

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.080
doesn't recommend continuing it either.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.680
Is he already

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.840
arranging for me to return to Switzerland soon?

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.400
Mr. Shen,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.160
Mr. Shen has already established

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.240
contact with the research institute.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.640
Everything is prepared.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.040
If we go back now,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.170
there's still hope.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.000
Madam.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.090
Madam, the General is missing.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.000
Mingjing.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.980
Why are you treating me like this?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.160
Who is this lady warrior?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.960
Throwing yourself at me

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.130
for what reason?

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800
Of course

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.360
to kidnap an innocent man.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.520
Today you'll comply whether you want to

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.920
or not.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.020
If that's the case,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.180
I'll just go along with it.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.810
Are you feeling better?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.850
That's why I could come see you.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.040
Are you tired?

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.200
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.320
Yu Youyi called.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.850
She's asking Zheng Ying to change her makeup.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.920
It's okay.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.180
I'll wait for you at the hotel.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.480
Go ahead.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.000
I'm going.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.410
I don't mind the sun.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.440
Don't let anyone photograph you meeting Mr. Shen privately.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.080
Trouble.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.400
Trouble.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.360
I'm just trouble to him.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.800
New materials.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.840
[Reason: developed feelings over time, she filmed with him]

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.770
The two developed feelings while working together.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.520
The actress has worked on films with the actor.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.680
The two were seen

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.960
being intimate on set.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.060
They might as well publish your ID numbers next.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.760
May I ask how

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.760
you plan to respond?

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.060
Let's not respond for now.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.560
This is already the second wave.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.640
Rumor has it that after tonight,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.920
they'll release actual video footage.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.160
What are we

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.360
going to do then?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.900
The PR department is already on standby.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.560
They'll craft an appropriate response

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.760
based on whatever video gets released.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.130
That's good.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.040
After all,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.570
Xiaoying is at a critical point in her career.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.480
Maintaining a single status

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.940
is always the safe choice.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.400
Alright then.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.740
I'll head back now.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.840
Get some rest.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.860
I'm also involved in this.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.960
Aren't you going to ask how I want to respond?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.680
I know.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.420
Denying our relationship

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.880
might upset you.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.240
But right now,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.960
it's the most appropriate solution.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.800
Otherwise, there will be many complications later.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.680
Trouble.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.200
So,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.640
am I really just a burden to you?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.360
No,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.920
I'm just worried about your future.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.200
Afraid I'll be trouble?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.400
But I don't care.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.880
I believe I can handle things well.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.220
Besides, you're right by my side.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.680
Even if I can't handle it,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.450
you'll have my back, won't you?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.760
You're so capable.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.480
These little troubles are nothing to you,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.360
right?

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.640
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.600
Is this relationship with me

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.000
really so embarrassing to you?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.720
I'm going back first.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.160
Get some rest.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.050
You're hiding something, aren't you?

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.000
Tell me.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.100
Good night.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.360
Mr. Shen.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880
I made her angry.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.120
Mr. Shen.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.420
Please stop torturing yourself.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.680
Didn't you say you would

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.080
for this girl who brightens others' lives,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.620
be more proactive about your treatment?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.720
Then why can't you make your relationship public?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.840
If I make it public,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.440
then for her entire life,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.240
she will always be labeled

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.040
as 'Shen Yifan's woman.'

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.520
She won't be allowed to have any happiness,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.040
or people will say,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.480
'Shen Yifan is dead,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.480
how can you still smile?'

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.240
She won't be allowed to have any romantic relationships.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.460
She would have to live her entire life

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.730
under everyone's scrutiny and judgment.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.160
I found her

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.210
to help her succeed,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.440
to help her become the best version of herself.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.130
I can't be with her while I'm alive,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.160
and I certainly can't

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.330
become her burden after death.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.880
Uncle, why are you crying?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.840
We're not crying.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.880
You're just acting, right?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.010
If this were really just a play,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.280
that would be wonderful.
