00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.530
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:31.949
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:35.786
Elizabeth?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.622
Elizabeth?

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:45.087
Elizabeth. Elizabeth.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.632
Where did she go?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.427
Where is it?

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.514
Not here.

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:58.976
MOM

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:01.853
ACCEPT

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.273
-At Jenny's aunt's house?
-Yes.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.984
She'll be in Hong Kong until next month,
so she told me to take her there.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.778
You should've told me beforehand.
I was startled.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.738
Anyway, where is Jenny's aunt's house?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.615
Beauté Palace.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.158
Beauté Palace?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.703
Hey, I should've gone with you.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.830
Why would you come with me?

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.623
What do you mean?

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.500
I heard it's really exclusive.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.836
I could've looked around
and said hi while I was there.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:26.962
Should I head over now?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.463
No, I'm hanging up now.

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:30.465
I'm leaving as soon as I drop her off.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.470
She has no idea how I feel.

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:38.682
Where is it?

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.927
That's not fair. I told you my wishes.

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.597
-Don't ask.
-Then spit out the food you just ate.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.478
Okay, then.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.438
Tell me if I catch you.

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:33.880
-Who is that?
-Kim Wooju.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.971
I swear that was Meri.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.607
Am I seeing things?

00:03:58.822 --> 00:03:59.990
Elizabeth, stop!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.867
Get back in there.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.240
Do you think he saw me?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.993
I'm sure he didn't.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.953
Either that, or he didn't recognize you.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.081
But didn't you say he was in Hong Kong?

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:54.711
Actually, he called me to tell me
that he's back in Korea.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.047
But I hung up because I was flustered.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.050
Do you think he came here knowingly?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.219
Well, then he wouldn't have just left.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.223
You're right. He wouldn't.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.768
But if in the worst case...

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.147
The worst case?

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.066
If he came knowing everything,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.028
then we can only tell the truth
and team up with him.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.279
No way.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.616
It's unlikely
that he'll give up on this house.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.535
That means he won't easily expose us.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.412
And since you two
are still legally married,

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.081
Beauté won't cancel your winning.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.712
I'd rather get caught

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.257
than team up with Wooju.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.802
Not after what he and his family did
to me and my mom.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.471
If he knew that I won this,

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.849
he'd gleefully threaten me with it.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.060
It's obvious that he'll demand this house
in exchange for keeping the secret.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.353
I can't bear to see that.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:58.024
I get that you're feeling wronged,
but what about the loan?

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:01.027
Isn't the money you borrowed
from your mom everything she had?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:07.200
The person who needs this house
more than anyone is you, not him.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:13.373
So, don't get emotional
and just think rationally.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:19.129
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.213
EPISODE 6

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.884
One, two, three, four.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.594
The other side.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.887
Left foot behind.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.224
Going low. One, two, three.

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.143
Let's stretch our hips. One.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.020
The other side. Two.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:36.771
Three.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.859
After a five-minute break,
we'll lightly stretch and start.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.944
Okay, let's all give a round of applause.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.196
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.453
You got new trainers.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.246
You noticed already.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.333
I told you that my feet hurt
if I run for a long time.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.918
Apparently, it's because
my arches collapsed.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:02.881
So, I had my feet scanned
and got custom trainers.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.466
I could fly away in these.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.469
-I guess exercise is all about the gear.
-Yes, it is.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.180
You should try
for a half-marathon this time, then.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.932
I was also thinking of trying out for it.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.102
He shows up regularly.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.024
He is the managing director.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.653
He's a true young-and-rich
who lives in Beauté Palace.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.156
Apparently, he's the reason Beauté hit

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.200
legendary sales numbers
three years in a row.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.160
Isn't he so dashing?

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.870
I guess he's good at his job.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.705
But he's so cold and unapproachable.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.583
He doesn't even stay for a beer afterward.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.169
I think he's single, though.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.171
Let him be. He seems busy.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.923
Okay, let's get started.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.467
If you don't feel well,
let me know straight away.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.885
Keep your pace in check.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.720
Also, keep your distance.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.273
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go!

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.459
Ma'am!

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.627
Are you okay?

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:23.795
-Stop!
-Hold!

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.130
-Ma'am!
-Can you hear me?

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.090
Oh, my gosh!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.759
Does anyone have their phone?

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.511
-Hey...
-What's wrong?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.054
Excuse me.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.101
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.477
Can you hear me?

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.651
Call 911 and tell them
that someone's in cardiac arrest.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:47.944
Okay.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:51.156
We're at Hangang River Park,
and we have a medical emergency.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.366
We're currently at... Please hold.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.410
Check if there's an AED
at the information center.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.870
I'll go get it.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.517
Stop recording and let's go.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:20.894
Why? This is great.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.396
-We'll be in trouble if we get caught.
-Give me a break.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.816
Oh, no.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.500
Let me take over.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.422
Excuse me, what are you doing?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.175
-Do you even know how?
-You should cover yourself up.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:12.195
I think this one will tip over
when we pull out the drawer

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.405
from the weight of the hangwa.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.492
Side-opening drawers would be better.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.538
I think so, too.
It would showcase the items better.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.166
But this part looks a little dull.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.085
It might be nice to add
an accent to the handles.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.712
How about fancy gold leaf detailing?

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.214
No.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.467
Let's focus on the design,
not the materials.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:39.305
A sleek linear or round design
would maintain that elegant simplicity.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.101
I'll come up
with more designs for the handle.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.186
Could you contact Monk Haeho, Songhee?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.437
Okay.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:59.534
We've set the packaging concept
as "jewelry box."

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.496
It symbolizes a jewelry box
containing hangwa

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.498
that's as precious
and beautiful as jewels.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:09.460
If we're allowed to make it function
like an actual jewelry box afterward,

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.671
it will be made of wood rather than paper.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.301
Wouldn't the costs spike?

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.554
Specialty paper
isn't exactly cheap, either.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.933
I got separate quotes for paper, wood,
and mother-of-pearl options.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:27.061
I think mother-of-pearl
would cater to specific preferences.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.271
And it might seem outdated.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.148
I also think wood would be better.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.567
We have a few VVIPs in their 20s and 30s.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.069
-Right.
-Let's settle with wood, then.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.071
And we'll adjust the cost accordingly.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.365
How's the thank-you card going?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:44.162
We're planning to incorporate a verse
from Monk Haeho's poetry.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.914
He's famous for his calligraphy.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.790
Who is Monk Haeho? Is he famous?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.292
Yes, he's trending these days.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.002
He's also famous for couples counseling.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.170
-True.
-Really?

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.797
-Did you get his approval?
-Yes, we did.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.800
We're currently deciding
which poem to calligraph.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.225
What happened?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.603
-I performed CPR for about seven minutes.
-Okay.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.855
-The patient is conscious now.
-Got it.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.565
We'll transport the patient now.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.434
Wait...

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.689
Passcode.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.984
It's 0901.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.862
Illegal filming carries
up to seven years in prison

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.239
and a 50-million-won fine.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.116
If forensics reveals more,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.160
you'll be charged
as a repeat offender with no leniency.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.205
If you are a repeat offender,

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.042
even rich parents will have
a hard time getting you out.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.335
Damn it.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.671
He made me do it.

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:17.755
I did not.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.841
Hey, you made me do it.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.926
You threatened me if I didn't record it.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.103
MOVE TO TRASH

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.274
I'll let you off
since it looks like your first time.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.734
But I won't the next time.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.871
Hey.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.419
Come here.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:12.810
Do you get good grades?

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.771
Pardon?

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.399
I do.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.151
You'll have to be really smart

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.113
if you want to pick up the crumbs
next to your rich friend.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.256
Okay, got it.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.885
Beauté confirmed.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.055
-It passed on the first try!
-Oh, yes!

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.765
Good work.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:53.184
No, you did all the work.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:54.519
Listen to you.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.604
Your social skills have come a long way.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.440
I could send you out
for sales now.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:02.527
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.737
I loved your packaging idea.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.572
It shows you put a lot of thought into it.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.367
I'm glad that I could be of help.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.334
-Is it your boyfriend?
-No.

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:22.130
You were smiling
from ear to ear while texting.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.256
Nonsense.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:24.841
How's your wedding preparation going?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:25.925
What?

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.516
Speak of the devil.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:36.978
Looks like he missed you already
and came running.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.772
Hello.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.607
Hi.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.421
And if Wooju contacts you again,

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:06.048
we'll need to find out his motives.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.429
What brings you here?

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:16.559
I just wanted to see you.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.064
Gosh, it's been a while
since I've been here.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:23.858
Was it three years ago?

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.903
You got fired
and rented this place to go independent.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.947
For the opening ritual,
we got boiled pork slices, Choco Pies,

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.949
and makgeolli from the convenience store.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.243
Do you remember?

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:42.001
After the ritual and sending Songhee home,

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.462
do you remember what we did?

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.258
-We kissed--
-Where are you getting at?

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.721
Nowhere, I was just reminiscing.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.811
Oh, what did you do on Sunday?

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:02.980
Why do you ask?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.024
My friend's acquaintance lives
at Beauté Palace,

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.236
so I went there for something,
and saw someone who looked just like you.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.489
I was just wondering if it really was you.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:18.579
I was in the office the whole weekend.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:19.789
I have a lot to do these days.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.207
Right?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.584
Of course, there's no way you'd be there.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.044
That's what I thought.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.420
You must've been mistaken.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.258
That's how I am these days.

00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:31.509
I'm seeing things now.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.054
It might be because you're
on my mind day and night.

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.014
These days...

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.018
I think a lot about you.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.273
Does your new girlfriend know

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.150
that you're acting like this?

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.277
I broke up with Jenny.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.488
I understand her position.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.156
She knew I wasn't over you.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.867
She told me to make a choice.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:58.619
And my choice...

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.039
was you, Meri.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.917
Honestly...

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.919
I just couldn't get over you.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.338
That's why I called
as soon as I came back to Seoul.

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.971
Since we're on the subject,

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.057
I want us to get back together.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:22.893
Like you generously used to,

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:26.188
could you forgive my momentary mistake?

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.315
I'm sorry,

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:28.899
but do I have to?

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.486
You were like this every time we argued.

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:36.699
And I understood
and forgave you every time.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.076
I thought that's what you do
when you love someone.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:40.661
But not anymore.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:45.291
It's not because of your mom,
who has always been embarrassed by me.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:46.834
It's also not because of you.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.046
It's because my mindset changed.

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.256
How can love change?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.507
It did for me

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.427
because I was hurt too many times.

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.973
Is this because I didn't
answer your call in Hong Kong?

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.643
-Back then, I was--
-Yes, I think it started then.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:07.897
I want to be with someone
who's there for me when I'm struggling.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.358
Not someone who wants me
only when they need me.

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:14.528
Meri.

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:19.116
This conversation itself
is ridiculous.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.576
It's already over between us.

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.287
Can you leave now? I need to work.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:24.914
What?

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.958
Oh, sure.

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:30.670
I guess you're a bit emotional right now.

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:33.005
Let's talk again later.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.944
I'VE PLANTED YOU LIKE A FLOWER IN MY HEART

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.112
CEO YOO MERI

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:15.441
Name?

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:24.992
HANGIL DELIVERY EXPRESS

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.053
MARKETING TEAM

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.679
What?

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:46.889
What's this?

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.516
Mr. Han.

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.601
Ms. Oh, Mr. Kim,
I think you need to see this.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.146
-What is it?
-What?

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:00.361
DRUNK PASSENGER DISRUPTS FLIGHT

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:04.740
ASSAULTING CREW AND IN-FLIGHT DISTURBANCES

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.450
THE FAMOUS MONK HAEHO DISRUPTED A FLIGHT

00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:10.788
Monk Haeho,
famous as a poet and life coach,

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.415
was arrested by the airport police

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.292
after causing
a drunken disturbance on a flight.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.671
On yesterday's 7:00 p.m. flight
from Incheon International Airport

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:22.550
to J.FC International Airport in New York,

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.135
video footage has emerged
showing disruptive behavior

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:28.097
and assault on the flight crew,
sparking public outrage.

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.560
The individual in the video
has been identified as Monk Haeho,

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:34.979
a public figure who has been active
as a poet and life coach,

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.689
using his influence for good...

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:40.609
Our calligraphy is doomed.

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:41.694
What do we do?

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:43.279
Haven't we finished that already?

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.780
Are the deliveries complete?

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.907
-When are they delivering?
-Today.

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:49.368
Can you check
if the deliveries have begun?

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.751
That's not a big deal.

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.337
We can just take out the cards.

00:23:00.421 --> 00:23:03.132
The issue is that the deliveries
have already begun.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.509
I just went to check
on the marketing team.

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:06.802
It's like someone died in there.

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:11.056
Beauté is calling
to complain and everything.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.893
If Grandma finds out,
Wooju might get fired.

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:15.394
It's that serious, Mom.

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.937
Calls from Beauté?

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.022
That's not good.

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:19.273
What are you saying?

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:22.109
With Wooju gone,
I can go back to the marketing team.

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:24.153
Hey!

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:28.824
That deal's happening because your dad
has connections with Beauté's CEO.

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:31.076
We can't mess it up.

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:34.705
This could blow back on your dad.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:40.502
Gosh, Wooju acts so smart,
yet how can he mess up like this?

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.754
Embarrassing his uncle...

00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:44.173
Honestly, he's useless.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.925
-Hey, Mom.
-What?

00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:49.094
Who will you save
if Dad and I fall in the water?

00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:50.804
What kind of ridiculous question is that?

00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.014
Are you hungry or something?

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:55.476
No, but I think
you'll choose your husband over your son.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.895
You think I should save you?

00:23:57.978 --> 00:23:59.730
We already taught you how to swim.

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:03.025
You were taught by the national athlete.
You should swim on your own.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.110
On the other hand, your dad can't swim.

00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:07.071
And he only knows me.

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.198
Even when I was getting married,

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.534
he caused a scene in front of my dad,
saying he couldn't live without me.

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:16.830
I married him,
thinking that it was like saving his life.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.542
Mom, let's not distort history.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:25.255
Everyone knows
that you were begging him to marry you.

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:29.051
Anyway, Mom, you need to depend on
and trust me, not Dad.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.554
When you get old,
I'll be the one next to you.

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.848
Gosh, how creepy.

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:37.267
Thank you.

00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:38.894
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.563
-What did they say?
-Well, for now,

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:44.149
they've put a hold on all delivery men
that they could contact.

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:46.568
But apparently, they can't get in touch
with a few of them.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.530
Texts have been sent,
but it seems they aren't checking them.

00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.907
It's hard to look at the phone
during deliveries.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:54.994
We should go.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:56.453
-Pardon?
-Now?

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.664
-Us?
-It's doable

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.541
if we split by region
and catch up with the trucks.

00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:04.378
It's only been an hour since they left,
so we'll catch up if we leave now.

00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.672
-We just remove the cards, right?
-Yes.

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.674
Sejung, give us the delivery addresses.

00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:09.758
Okay.

00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:13.012
Ms. Oh.

00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:14.763
Here's yours, Mr. Kim.

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:17.182
How are we supposed to do this?

00:25:18.142 --> 00:25:20.019
-Where is Ms. Yoo?
-I'm right here.

00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:21.520
Ms. Yoo!

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.897
How could you let this happen?

00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:24.982
I'm sorry.

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:26.692
This isn't Ms. Yoo's fault.

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.570
-Shall we get going then?
-Okay.

00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:33.866
Come with me, Songhee.

00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:37.703
Sejung, you come with me.
I'll go get ready.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.787
Us together?

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.710
DELIVERY ADDRESS LIST

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.049
Sir!

00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:51.842
I'm calling from Myungsoondang.

00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:54.219
-You're out on delivery, right?
-Ask him where he is.

00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:55.554
Where about are you?

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:59.058
-Yongsan?
-Tell him we're coming.

00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:01.852
We're on our way now.
There's a mix-up in the orders, sir.

00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:03.479
Yes.

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.272
Yes, okay.

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.858
Thank you so much!

00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.778
What a relief.

00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:14.114
He couldn't start the deliveries yet
due to the traffic.

00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:15.866
Let's go to Yongsan Park!

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:30.547
Here.

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:34.259
I think taking the taxi would be faster.

00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:36.804
This is the best
if we are using shortcuts.

00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:40.349
Mr. Han, when did you start
biking to work?

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:42.601
Me? I do this from time to time.

00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:45.145
-Haven't you seen me?
-You have a license, right?

00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:47.731
Geez, my family owns a Chinese restaurant,

00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:49.775
so I've been riding one
since middle school.

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.777
Hop on already. Come this way.

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:55.405
Good.

00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:57.074
Okay.

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:58.951
Here we go. Hold on tight.

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.170
HANGIL DELIVERY
EXPRESS

00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:21.181
Gosh.

00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.559
-Sir.
-Sir!

00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:39.783
Give it to me.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.162
I'm really sorry.

00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:45.998
This was really important.

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.541
Oh, I see.

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:55.382
Mr. Han, is this how you do this?

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:57.885
Gosh, don't make it crooked.

00:27:57.968 --> 00:28:00.679
-They'll notice that it's been undone.
-Oh, how do you tie this?

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:02.723
Let me. Give it here.

00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.101
You go like this.

00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:09.897
And if you go like this...

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:12.941
It looks weird.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.610
I told you.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.904
Sejung, should we call Ms. Yoo?

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:18.864
Hold both ends.

00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:21.617
And tie it once.

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.454
Create a hook with your left hand.

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:30.000
-No, this part has to be on the outside.
-Oh, I see.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.419
Like this?

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.503
Yes, that's right.

00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:39.051
Put this end through the hook
to complete the knot.

00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:40.510
And lastly,

00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:43.972
just tidy up this middle part
so that it's pretty.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:47.309
-I did it!
-It worked!

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.311
-We did it!
-Good.

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:53.732
Oh, where is Mr. Kim?

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:55.484
I thought you went with him.

00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.571
I'm waiting for the deliveryman here.

00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:04.326
Mr. Kim went to get the package
that had already been delivered nearby.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.600
Okay.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:30.560
What?

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.605
Calm down.

00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:35.148
Good boy.

00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:37.693
I wasn't trying to steal this.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.862
I'll just put it back, okay?

00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:46.243
Hey!

00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:10.934
Okay, sit.

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:12.686
Good boy.

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:13.937
Wait.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.400
Such a good boy.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.484
Sit.

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:20.777
Good. Now, wait.

00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.031
Wait.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.575
I'm so sorry.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:29.286
His leash slipped out of my hand
while I was parking.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:31.580
No, it's okay.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.957
I'm really sorry.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.501
-Let's go, baby.
-Bye.

00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.130
He is so lucky.

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:41.631
I was just about to knock him over.

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:44.342
Why do you laugh?

00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.303
Nothing. Let's go.

00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:53.268
Anyway, where did you get that?

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.520
What do you mean, where?
It's my emergency snack.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.522
-Do you carry around jerky?
-Yes.

00:30:57.606 --> 00:30:59.983
I've got crispy rice snacks, gummies,
and some red ginseng.

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:01.193
Tell me if you get hungry.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:03.445
You're like
a walking convenience store.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.281
It looks heavy.
Do you want me to carry it for you?

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.617
-I'm fine.
-Come on. Let me.

00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:11.369
It's really okay.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:21.387
Officail Website : kissasia.id  Translate by =Qari= @Team Viki

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:13.413
It's heavy.

00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:16.249
Those shoulders look sturdy.
You should carry it.

00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:21.797
Here.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.049
This is for the jerky.

00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:30.514
We also just wrapped up. Heading home now.

00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:34.684
Mr. Han and Sejung are
also clocking out right at the site.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.687
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:41.691
Ms. Oh and Songhee said
they've completed the retrieval.

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:44.069
Are you heading home?

00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:47.614
Actually, I need to go back to the office.

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.658
I have a draft to send over.

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:52.619
I'll drop you off.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.082
WOOJU

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:02.504
It's Kim Wooju.

00:32:03.255 --> 00:32:04.297
Pick it up.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:06.341
We should find out why he's calling.

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.093
I met with him already.

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:25.235
Please pick up.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:31.366
The call can't
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:35.078
She's not picking up her phone again.

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:42.002
Oh, my gosh. You startled me.

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:44.880
What do you want with Meri?

00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:47.883
Don't listen in on other people's calls.

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:50.510
Are you going somewhere?

00:32:50.594 --> 00:32:52.888
I'm flying to Japan with Mom tonight.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:53.972
To Beppu Onsen.

00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.432
When are you coming back?

00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:58.059
It's a three-day package trip.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.188
-There's beef bone soup in the fridge.
-Okay.

00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:07.277
Don't even think
about contacting Meri again.

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.363
If she finds out
that you're marrying a rich girl,

00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:12.407
she might cause a scene at the wedding.

00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:17.787
She's probably already fuming
because Mom and her mom had a fight.

00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:22.500
Mom met with Meri's mom?

00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:24.211
-When?
-What do you mean, when?

00:33:24.294 --> 00:33:25.629
When you were in Hong Kong.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:29.257
It seemed like Meri hadn't told her mom
that you guys broke off the engagement.

00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:32.093
So, Mom went berserk there and then.

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.179
Why would you do that?

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:36.681
What do you mean?
It was to stop her from clinging to you.

00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:38.600
Geez, I can't believe this!

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:40.477
No wonder.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.270
That's why Meri is so mad.

00:33:42.646 --> 00:33:44.856
If she doesn't forgive me,
it's all your and Mom's fault.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.691
Go and be ready to apologize, okay?

00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:49.819
Where are you going?

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.239
Aren't you going to drop us off
at the airport?

00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:55.158
Hi, Songhee.

00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:58.328
I can't get a hold of Meri.
Do you know where she is right now?

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.291
Oh, we had a small argument.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:05.835
You know.

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:07.254
Just a lovers' quarrel.

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:11.967
She's out on business right now,
so she might be hard to reach.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:15.220
There's been an incident at Myungsoondang.

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.639
It's one of our clients.

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:20.725
She's probably
with the team leader from there.

00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:21.935
The office?

00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:24.229
Yes, I think she'll head to the office
once she's done.

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:25.730
I see. Thank you.

00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:27.357
I'll treat you to a meal later.

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:40.537
PLEASE FIND THE ATTACHED
DESIGN DRAFT YOU REQUESTED

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.914
DESIGN DRAFT B
DESIGN DRAFT A

00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:46.418
That's a relief.

00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:48.753
That Wooju doesn't know anything.

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:51.464
But you know there's still a risk, right?

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:53.174
Of course.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.051
By the way,

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:57.679
did you mean what you said back then?

00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.014
About what?

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:03.143
That you wouldn't team up with Wooju
even if you had to get caught.

00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:05.520
Oh, that.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.106
I just said it in the moment.

00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:10.400
Right?

00:35:10.692 --> 00:35:12.402
I did say it in the heat of the moment,

00:35:13.403 --> 00:35:14.404
but I'm sticking with it.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.323
You see,

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.326
I thought it through after what you said.

00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:21.620
It's a lot of money.

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.371
What wouldn't I do for it?

00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:25.832
But I just couldn't.

00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.505
I know. I seem pathetic, don't I?

00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:35.091
That's just me.

00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:37.844
I'm the kind
who just goes all in, no brakes.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.681
We'll do it together.

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:46.311
Come to think of it,
Wooju hasn't done anything.

00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:48.521
You entered the raffle.

00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:49.939
And you won the raffle.

00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:51.608
I went to the ceremony with you.

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:54.944
It feels wrong for someone
who did nothing to profit from it.

00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:56.571
We did all the work.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.325
Mr. Kim.

00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:02.369
Thank you so much.

00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:05.830
I won't ever forget
what you've done for me.

00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:11.086
I was actually really nervous
this whole time.

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:14.255
In case you'd say you want out.

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:19.803
I was really struggling,
but I couldn't tell anyone.

00:36:30.772 --> 00:36:35.193
I'm really going to do my best,
so you hang in there, too.

00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.569
We're close to the end.

00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.822
Okay.

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:40.865
Then I'll trust you and go with it, okay?

00:36:41.658 --> 00:36:42.659
Okay.

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.511
-On the left.
-I see it.

00:37:06.683 --> 00:37:07.684
Who's that?

00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:08.995
Where are they going?

00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:20.507
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.366
Are you a resident?

00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:50.495
I'm not. I'm just visiting.

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:51.871
Visiting which house?

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.040
Well...

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.875
This is my aunt's address.

00:38:55.959 --> 00:38:57.502
Unit 2 of Complex 3 at Beauté Palace.

00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:00.004
Unit 2 of Complex 3.

00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:01.214
Okay.

00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:18.273
Thank you for dropping me off.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.899
-Drive home safe.
-Okay.

00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:21.442
I'll leave after I see you head in.

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:23.194
No, you should get going.

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:24.904
I'll get going after I see you go in.

00:39:24.988 --> 00:39:27.240
I'll go in after I see you get going.

00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:28.992
All right, then.

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.827
Yes.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.830
Yes, I'm on my way now.
I'll look for it in the car.

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:35.373
Okay.

00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:05.778
Gosh, he's standing right there,
so I can't get going.

00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:10.575
You should leave a bit later.

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:13.244
Since there was a mistake
in the deliveries today,

00:40:13.328 --> 00:40:15.955
someone might need to ask something.

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:17.040
Shall I?

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.875
I'll leave later, then.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.298
Do you need any hammering or fixing done?

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.175
No, I'm okay.

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.260
The management office
sorts it out for me if I ask.

00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:32.138
Gosh, what if they catch you living alone?

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:33.348
Tell me while I'm here.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.850
There isn't anything.

00:40:39.312 --> 00:40:40.313
What's that?

00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:49.405
I can hang the curtains myself
since you installed the bar for me.

00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.907
It's fine.

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.660
This is when a husband comes in handy.

00:40:58.581 --> 00:40:59.624
"Husband"?

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:04.337
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.713
I mean...

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.353
Oh, gosh. Are you okay?

00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:23.147
Are you okay?

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.400
Yes, I'm fine.

00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:28.236
-Are you really okay?
-Yes.

00:41:32.448 --> 00:41:35.159
Oh, no. Your clothes are all wet.

00:41:35.702 --> 00:41:37.578
I'll do it. Don't worry about it.

00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:43.751
It's okay.

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.629
I'll dry this while you dry your hair.

00:41:46.713 --> 00:41:47.714
Okay, then.

00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.051
I'm sure it'll dry soon.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.931
By the way, just call me
if you ever need someone tall.

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.016
Okay.

00:42:01.436 --> 00:42:02.729
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:42:02.812 --> 00:42:05.064
I don't have anything tomorrow.

00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:09.193
-Do you want...
-How about a lunch...

00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:14.198
Let's get lunch tomorrow.

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:16.242
Sure.

00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:26.085
Where did they go?

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.214
I'm sure they went this way.

00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:34.302
That's 7794.

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.369
That guy...

00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:09.837
What?

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.672
So, it was Meri back then.

00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:33.361
What's with my expression?

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.071
I look so tense.

00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:40.576
Next time we retake it,
I'll try to be more natural...

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.789
Why would we retake it?

00:43:57.677 --> 00:43:59.512
He's out of my league.

00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:30.251
Yoo Meri.

00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:38.759
Kim Wooju.

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:50.897
What are you doing here?

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.899
And who was that man before?

00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.108
The one who dropped you off.

00:44:57.403 --> 00:44:58.738
Did you follow me?

00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:01.490
Yes.

00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:03.993
I went to your office
because you wouldn't pick up my calls.

00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:06.245
But then you got in some guy's car.

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.416
And you two went into this house.

00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:19.592
That day, you saw me, didn't you?

00:45:19.675 --> 00:45:21.052
On the roof.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.141
You did.

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:29.560
Why did you lie?

00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:30.645
You said you worked.

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:33.564
I didn't want to tell you where I lived.

00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:34.690
You live here?

00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:39.111
You lost everything in that rental con,
so how are you...

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:42.031
No way. Are you...

00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:48.746
working part-time?

00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.164
You work as a housekeeper?

00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:53.668
Yes, it's my friend's house.

00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:55.836
But because no one lives here,

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.172
I'm currently managing it
while staying here.

00:45:58.798 --> 00:46:00.716
A friend? Who?

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:02.385
None of your business.

00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:10.643
Is this that guy's house?

00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:12.270
It's not.

00:46:17.692 --> 00:46:18.693
Leave.

00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:20.987
Open this.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:27.034
Then who was that guy?

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:29.245
Why did he drop you off
this late at night?

00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:31.622
Are you cheating on me?

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:35.584
What you did is called cheating.

00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:38.504
Who I meet is none of your business.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.260
Meri, now I know why you're so angry.

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.265
It's because of my mom.

00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:52.768
I'll apologize
for how my mom talked to yours.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.228
You don't need to.

00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:56.647
And I have nothing to do
with your family now.

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:01.152
I told you I'm sorry.

00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.154
How many times do I have to say it?

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:04.697
Just accept the damn apology.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:06.574
What?

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.992
Do you want me to kneel?

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:10.036
Stop it.

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:12.121
Why do I have to accept your apology?

00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:14.123
I don't want to, so stop apologizing.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.917
I don't need you or your apology anymore.

00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:29.430
Move.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.724
Let go. What are you doing?

00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:33.434
You're acting like this
because you're guilty!

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.108
Get out. I'm going to call the police!

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:42.902
Go on because I'm about to lose it.

00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:45.905
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

00:47:45.988 --> 00:47:47.531
Yes, I'm crazy.

00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:50.493
How could you start dating another man
only months after the breakup?

00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:51.994
Were you always like this?

00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:55.081
The house is that punk's, isn't it?

00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:57.792
He's also the one
you were with on the rooftop.

00:48:02.838 --> 00:48:03.964
Look at you.

00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:05.091
You're flustered.

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:07.301
I got you, didn't I?

00:48:08.344 --> 00:48:09.512
Got what?

00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:11.138
Get out now.

00:48:12.473 --> 00:48:15.810
Were you cheating on me with him?

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:20.439
And yet you treated me
like a cheating scumbag?

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:24.777
Let's see how well off
your rich boyfriend is.

00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:50.553
What's this?

00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:54.473
-Get out.
-What are you doing?

00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:56.725
-Get out!
-Let me go!

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:58.144
I said, let go.

00:48:58.227 --> 00:48:59.395
Let me go!

00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:01.105
Let go!

00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.131
Doctor!

00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:31.677
I checked your CT scan.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.264
It seems you fractured your wrist
when you tried to break the fall.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:36.974
Fractured?

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:39.894
There's just a small crack

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:41.979
in your right pelvis and thigh,
not fractured.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.316
Let's admit you and keep an eye on it.

00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:46.400
A crack?

00:49:47.735 --> 00:49:48.736
Doctor, tell me...

00:49:49.487 --> 00:49:51.780
Am I going to be paralyzed
from the waist down?

00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:54.283
It's not that bad.

00:49:54.366 --> 00:49:57.661
For now, the guardian should assist
the patient when moving.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:00.247
A fall could turn that crack
into a full fracture.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.000
Okay, but I'm not his guardian.

00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:04.668
Meri!

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.964
My arm hurts. Come here, hurry.

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:11.258
What do you want?

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.927
It hurts so much.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.303
What do you want me to do about it?

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:15.638
Kiss it better.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.228
It seems the VVIPs' response

00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:24.772
to the founding anniversary gift
was quite good.

00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:27.107
Beauté contacted us
to express their gratitude.

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:28.943
There was some trouble with the cards.

00:50:29.902 --> 00:50:30.903
That's right.

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:33.405
I heard from Ms. Kim.

00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:35.074
I heard that Wooju handled it well.

00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:39.286
It's really thanks
to all the members of the marketing team.

00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.539
Do your best to support him.

00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:44.792
Your job is to help Wooju
lead Myungsoondang.

00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:47.753
That's why you're in that position.

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.713
CEO KO PHILNYUN

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.968
Of course, well noted.

00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:17.866
Hello, sir.

00:51:19.368 --> 00:51:21.495
She's the wife of the late Mr. Ko.

00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:28.127
I don't know
what to say to console you.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.297
Please stay strong.

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:35.050
Have you been well?

00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:36.844
Yes.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.637
What brings you here?

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:39.847
To meet with the chairwoman.

00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.433
Let's go. She must be waiting.

00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:05.164
I found this while I was sorting out
my late husband's things.

00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:07.291
This was deep inside the drawer.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.919
It seemed important.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.648
FINANCIAL STATEMENT

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:47.206
210,000 TRANSFERRED

00:52:52.211 --> 00:52:53.462
CONSULTANT FEE
220,000 TRANSFERRED

00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:56.799
It looks like J Consulting
is embezzling some of it.

00:52:57.341 --> 00:53:00.094
I found it odd
and contacted our US counterpart,

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:03.722
and the company itself seems to have
exaggerated their performance.

00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:18.696
J CONSULTING

CONSULTANT FEE

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:35.212
Yes, dear.

00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.423
What made you call me at this hour?

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:40.342
I was just balancing the books.

00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:43.429
I have to send it to Myungsoondang
by the end of this week.

00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:48.183
What do you mean, clean up the accounts?

00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:51.729
Mr. Ko's wife came to the company
to meet with the chairwoman.

00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:55.107
Start by shredding every company document,
and proceed with the business closure.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.734
Also, close down the restaurant.

00:53:57.776 --> 00:53:58.819
Okay.

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.612
No harm in being cautious.

00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:04.950
But the chairwoman
doesn't know about this, right?

00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:11.707
Mom.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.460
Sweetie, you're up.

00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:19.006
Do you want to talk to Dad?

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.174
Daddy?

00:54:21.383 --> 00:54:22.593
Daddy.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.804
Henry, did you just wake up?

00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:27.139
How's your cold?

00:54:27.473 --> 00:54:31.185
You're all better now?
What a good boy.

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:32.978
Daddy will go back to the US soon.

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:35.439
Stay healthy so we can go camping again.

00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:37.524
Be good and listen to your mom.

00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:39.860
I can't wait
to see you, Daddy.

00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:41.862
Me too.

00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.420
Director Jang, are you busy?

00:54:58.504 --> 00:54:59.838
No, come in.

00:54:59.922 --> 00:55:01.381
CFO JANG HANGU

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.676
I was just waiting for you.

00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:09.139
Thank you.

00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:12.059
You can drop the formality
when it's just us.

00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:14.728
Oh, okay. Uncle.

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:17.481
Good work on sorting the issue out
for Beauté Department Store.

00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:20.567
I've cleared things up with them,
so don't worry.

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:23.946
They could've made this into a big deal.

00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:26.782
But it seems to have gone over smoothly,
all thanks to you.

00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:28.742
Come to me
if you ever face any trouble again.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:30.160
I can help you.

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.579
Okay.

00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.123
This isn't ours.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.001
I got it from a café across the street.

00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:39.461
It's tastier than ours.

00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:40.629
Drink this in secret.

00:55:42.714 --> 00:55:43.715
Thanks.

00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:54.226
Thank you. Thank you.

00:55:55.227 --> 00:55:56.853
Gosh, my documents...

00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:00.941
J Consulting America COMPANY FINANCIALS

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.444
-It's fine now.
-Oh, okay.

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.740
-I'll get going then.
-Okay, thanks.

00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:21.753
Seriously.

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.298
Meri, my leg.

00:56:25.591 --> 00:56:27.551
Be gentle!

00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:36.977
Thank you.

00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:40.063
You still can't reach your mom?

00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:43.066
No, I don't think she enabled roaming.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.776
And my sister's phone is turned off.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.028
What about your dad?

00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:49.364
You know he got dismissed
from the university and started farming.

00:56:50.449 --> 00:56:53.619
He's been lying low alone in Jeju,
but he's also not very well.

00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:58.874
Hey, shouldn't you stay with me for a bit?

00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:02.419
Technically, I slipped
because you turned off the lights.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.881
Are you serious?

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:08.342
You're the one who trespassed.

00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:10.093
That's a crime.

00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:11.595
I could report you to the police.

00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.722
Since when did you become so heartless?

00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:14.931
You weren't like this before.

00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:16.141
Yes, I was.

00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:18.352
I've always been heartless
to people I don't like.

00:57:19.705 --> 00:57:29.705

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.649
-Meri.
-What?

00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:25.150
Meri, here.

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:31.031
Being in pain is making me hungrier.

00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:35.577
I saw a sundae soup place downstairs.

00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:37.621
Could you pick some up for me?

00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:39.998
You've got a lot of nerve, seriously.

00:57:40.832 --> 00:57:42.584
I had it cleaned.

00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:44.795
Thank you for that day.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:46.588
From Yoon Jingyeong.

00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:56.306
Where did he go?

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.308
I need to give this back to him.

00:58:07.067 --> 00:58:08.860
Illegal filming carries
up to seven years in prison

00:58:08.944 --> 00:58:10.195
and a 50-million-won fine.

00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:12.948
If forensics reveals more,

00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:16.076
you'll be charged
as a repeat offender with no leniency.

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:19.746
I'll let you off
since it looks like your first time.

00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.249
But I won't the next time.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.129
What is he, really?

00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:31.425
He's such a mystery.

00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:36.555

REAL FRUIT JUICE
GUMMIES

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:51.528
I've been saving this, but it's my treat

00:58:52.487 --> 00:58:53.947
since I am grateful.

00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:45.874
Do you know?

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.918
You're the first person
to introduce me to sundae soup.

00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:52.088
You took me to that famous place
in the Jongno underground.

00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:54.216
I couldn't even eat such things back...

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.092
It's hot.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:03.683
Looking back,

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.477
I discovered a lot of things
thanks to you.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.148
You also showed me that you can eat
steamed sweet potatoes with their peel.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.067
I was taught to peel everything.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.696
It looks like I taught you
so many useful things.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.533
So, I'm always grateful to you.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.828
You always teach me new things.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:29.334
Being in the hospital reminds me of this.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:33.547
In the human body,
they say there are 30 trillion cells.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.007
And 330 billion of them

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.219
die and regenerate daily.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.474
The cells that let you down
a few months ago don't exist anymore.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:45.642
They're all gone.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:48.395
Now I'm completely made up of new cells.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.896
I'm a new person.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.442
So, Meri, let's forget the past

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.570
and start anew.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.448
Okay.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:03.326
I'll be cool and forgive you
for that brief fling with another guy.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.786
It's not like I'm all that innocent.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.413
So, let's be generous

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:08.707
and just call it even.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:15.547
What are you trying to pull?

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.048
People don't change.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:20.510
Are you done? I'm cleaning up now.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.096
I'm not done. Hey.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.932
I thought you were done
since you kept talking.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.183
No, I'm sorry.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.561
Just another bite, please.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:30.937
Please?

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.691
Eat it yourself then.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:36.818
Hey, Meri.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.320
Hey, Meri!

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.035
Was the cell metaphor lame?

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.416
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.335
-Do you want...
-How about a lunch...

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.213
Let's get lunch tomorrow.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.090
Sure.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.312
-I'll order when my company arrives.
-Sure.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:33.667
Hello.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.545
I guess he hasn't been discharged yet.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.048
He will tomorrow.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.430
Your jacket. The windbreaker.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.609
Oh, that's just my way
of saying thank you.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.198
You seemed pretty skilled at CPR.
Did you learn from somewhere?

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.034
When I was still a student,

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:10.954
I worked part-time as safety staff
at an amusement park.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.791
Anyway, thank you for that day.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:15.875
Personally, too.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.963
I saw you make them delete my photos.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.176
Thank you.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.388
I can't grant an extension
to the hospital stay,

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.099
but I'll keep a bottle of liquor for you
at your usual bar.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:33.309
Enjoy it when you have time.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.477
It's my token of gratitude.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:35.603
It's okay.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.272
It wasn't a big deal.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.857
Anyone would've done the same.

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:40.567
So, no need.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.903
No, I... Wait.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:54.831
I haven't confessed to him,
but why does it feel like I got dumped?

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.668
That felt oddly unsettling.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.074
Oh, right.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:30.867
I'm so sorry.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.494
I completely forgot.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.412
Is that so?

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.457
-Did you have lunch then?
-No.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.501
I'm currently at the hospital.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.878
Are you sick?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.255
No, not me. It's...

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.593
My friend got hurt.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.473
I was busy nursing all through the night,
so I forgot to call you.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.186
Was your friend hurt badly?

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.357
It's okay. We can eat together next time.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.943
Don't worry about me
and focus on nursing your friend.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.445
It's miserable
when there's no one around while sick.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.365
Okay.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.504
JINGYEONG

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:30.218
Hey, Wooju. Did you eat?

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:31.761
No, not yet.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.596
You haven't? What were you doing?

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.098
-What about you?
-Me?

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.683
I most certainly...

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.936
have not eaten yet.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:41.146
Do you want to eat together?

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.439
Sure, let's grab lunch together.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:45.525
I'll go to you.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.944
It'll be a break-time
by the time you get here.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:49.779
Okay.

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:56.578
Meri.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:07.964
Come closer, will you?

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.807
I wouldn't even have been able to go
to the bathroom without you.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:20.435
Call in a caregiver tomorrow.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:22.896
They're uncomfortable.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.565
If I'm at unease--

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.317
You're not dying.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.652
I'm busy. I don't have time for you.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.822
And if you keep this up,
I'm going to report you for trespassing.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.247
But I'm in pain.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.392
Mr. Kim.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.024
You...

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.079
What are you doing?

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.251
That's the friend who got hurt?

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.086
Yes.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.138
What are you doing?
I'm a patient, so don't do anything.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.348
Where is his room?

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.142
It's Room 601.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.853
I told you to call me
if you need someone tall.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.482
Let me go.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.150
I said, let go!

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.735
Hey, Meri!

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.363
Meri!

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.489
Let me go!

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.866
Meri!

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.744
Yoo Meri! Meri!

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:15.300
I'm sorry for not telling you
that it was Kim Wooju.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.968
And for not showing up to lunch.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.137
Did you get any sleep?

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.471
You said you were up all night.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.557
I'll get some sleep now.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.517
Then, go get some sleep.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.144
Let's talk more
when you're feeling better.

01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.354
Are you angry?

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:32.692
I'm not angry.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.403
But I'm not feeling great, either.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:41.159
I mean, why didn't you call me yesterday?

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.995
Or you could have told me earlier today.

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:47.665
I'm always asking you for a favor.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.209
How can I ask you to come for Kim Wooju?

01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:52.045
Do you have to nurse him?

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:55.673
It's not like I wanted to do it, either.

01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:59.385
He's throwing a fit,
and we couldn't reach his family.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.012
So, I couldn't just leave him alone.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.430
Just leave him.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.724
Why do you care for such a person?

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:08.019
After all you went through,
do you still have feelings for him?

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.103
No.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:10.563
It's because...

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.943
If I just left,
he'd lose it and cause trouble.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.696
It seemed like he'd do anything
to find that house's owner.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:20.740
Also...

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:25.411
Even if it didn't end well with him,
he was hurt in front of me.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.748
Wait.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.416
Last time,

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.795
didn't you say to team up with Wooju
if push came to shove?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.421
I did.

01:09:36.297 --> 01:09:37.298
Right.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.092
I said that.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.385
So, what's with you?

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.223
Why are you so angry?

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:48.851
Well...

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.522
Maybe it's because I like you.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.151
I don't like seeing you with another guy.

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:45.116
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.285
Does it bother you
that I like you?

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.037
I think I really loved Meri.

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:51.330
Who is Miso?

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.874
The name keeps popping up.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.125
She's someone you liked, right?

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.711
He's the grandson
of Myungsoondang's CEO.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:11:00.089
Can't you just end it on your end, Meri?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:04.886
Why doesn't
the guy I like see me as a woman?

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.096
You got it wrong.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.514
I like Meri.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.601
All is well as long as
Meri is cherished.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.144
It's not because I'm sorry.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.021
It's because I like you.
