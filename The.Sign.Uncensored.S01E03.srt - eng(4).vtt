Hey!

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.800
What you did tonight...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.840
was a serious breach of discipline.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320
If you really think you are good enough…

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.760

Shit!

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.439
You go drop him off at his condo then.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.760
- But I’m drunk too. I can’t do that.
- So am I.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.440
Geez, what’s wrong with him?

Why are you so drunk?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.520
Please get your hand off my friend.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.720
I’m afraid I can’t since he’s my brother.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.120
- But he’s with...
- Thank you for looking after him.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.840
You can leave him with me now.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.320
Ah, my head…

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.079
Let’s go then.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.600
You..

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.520
Can you walk? We’re almost there.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.160
Wait.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.200
Have we met before?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.760
I’m not sure.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.680
We might have met before but I couldn’t remember it.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.760
But we’d probably meet more often after this.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.600
Please excuse us.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.160
Yai, are you all right?
Of course.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.280
- Yai.
- Yeah?
Do you think Phaya and Tharn are now...

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.320
Let’s drink for my bro then.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.080
My bro has finally lost his virginity.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
Cheers!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.720
- Down it.
- You've finished your last drink.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.800
Hey, I thought you were dropping Tharn off. Why are you back so early?
Yeah.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.079
Or did I give you a wrong location?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.839
That’s why you’re back here so fast.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.000
Some guy named...

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.240
Slow...Slowmotion or something like that.
Slowmotion? Is that even a name?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.160
Hey! Listen to me.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.120
Whatever. He just parked in front of us and said...

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.280
that he’s Tharn’s big brother.
So, Tharn just left with him.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:48.880
Ahhh, Dr. Chalothorn.
Yeah, that Chalothorn. Who is he?
Tharn and I have known him since when we were kids.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.320
He’s always looking after Tharn.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.280
Good for him. Now he’d have someone to look after him whenever he’s drunk.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.560
Isn’t a doctor supposed to take care of a sick patient?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.840
How come he has to take care of a drunkard too.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.120
- A doctor takes care of a drunken man.
- How would he take care of him?
So do I.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.040
How would he take care of him?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.000
Shower?!

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.800
- Take a shower
- Yeah

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.240
How can you let him taking a shower with a stranger?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.480
Why not?
We did that a lot too.
A lot? Did you say ‘a lot’?!

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.760
So often?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.200
What’s wrong with you?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.960
Calm down, man. You’d break all the glasses.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.320
- I’m more worried about the beer.
- Be careful, P'Yai, be careful.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.240
Hey, where are you going?
I’ll be back!

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.320
Huh? What happened?
Whatever. Go ahead and down it, Yai.
Yeah. Bottoms up.

Where are you?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.640
In my room.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.720
Are you okay?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.720
Yeah, I’m okay.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.720
Ah my head. I really need to sleep.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.840
- I gotta go now.
- Wait, Tharn!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.760
Go take a shower first.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.760

Yeah.

Don’t drink too much next time, okay?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.840
It’s not good for yourself.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.760
I didn’t want to. Yai made me do it.
It’s all right. Come on then.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760
Get up first.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.360
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.120
Are you okay?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.760
- I’m so sleepy. Can I go to bed?
- Not yet.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.280
Take a shower and get changed first so that you’d feel better.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.080
Let’s get up. Can you do it?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.720
Oh, you’re quite heavy.

- Oh, my
- I miss you so much.
Let me go.
Why are you reeking of alcohol?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.440
Did you go drinking or bathing in it?

Oh, just quit it. Where have you two been?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.600
You spent a lot of time outdoor, didn’t you? Now you looked a lot tanner.

And a lot thinner too.

Look at his arm muscles. Look at those muscular arms, Grandma.
- Looks very muscular, very muscular.
- One more time.
- Give her one more.
- Look
- Ouch.
- Don’t bad-mouth your brother.

What were you thinking, sitting in the dark like that?
Why didn’t you go take a shower and get some rest?

Eww, it smells of alcohol.

- This one is Tharn. He’s my friend at the training camp.
- Um

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.880
This one is the girl I often saw in my dream.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.840
I don’t know why I dream of her quite often these days.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:58.560
That’s strange. Usually, you’d only dream of her on the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.680
How come it happens very often these days?

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.840
I have no idea. I don’t why it happens too.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.440
I think you’re probably tired and stressed from work.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.560
That’s why you keep dreaming about it so often.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.360
Huh

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.360
Grandma.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.480
I think maybe it’s time for me to find out...

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.800
what those dreams actually mean.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.040
How will you do that?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.680
You’ve been researching and studying about them for so many years, haven’t you?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.640
I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:18:01.120
(Phone buzzing)

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.400
(Big bro Yai)

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.520
(Phone buzzing)

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.160
Did I do anything weird last night?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.640
Hey, what’s up?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.800
Are you a sober now? Did you just pass out last night?

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.360
Yeah.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840
I have no idea how I got home.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.840
I only remember that I was with Phaya.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.160
That’s right.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.840
Phaya was supposed to drop you off at home.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.920
But the doctor came and took you home instead.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.440
I can’t remember a thing.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.160
When Phaya came back to the table...

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.840
he was really upset and kept asking me about you and the doctor.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.280
What did you tell him?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680
Well...

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.600
I told him that...

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.720
I can’t remember either.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.640
I got so wasted last night.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.000
(P'Yai laughing)

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.320
Oops, am I too loud?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.640
I’m sorry, babe.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.840
We both got so wasted last night.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.760
I know, right? It was so much fun though.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.920
By the way,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.000
why didn’t you tell Phaya the truth?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.520
The truth?

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.240
What truth?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.680
That you like him.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.880
Geez, who likes him?!

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.240
You do.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.120
I thought you like him, don’t you?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.560
Like him, my arse

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.520
(Bell sound)

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.160
I gotta go.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.200
Okay. Bye.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.160
Ouch!

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280
(Bell sound)

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.160
(Sound of door opening)

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.800
Hi, doc.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.000
It’s ready, Tharn.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.480
Boiled rice, fresh from the oven.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.920
Let me do that.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.720
Eat with while it’s still hot.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.600
So that you’d feel better from the hangover.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.080
Thank you.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.560
Is everything all right?

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.080
Does it taste that bad?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.720
Oh no. It’s really good.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.560
The food you buy for me always tastes really good.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040
Thank you so much.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.960
And...

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.360
thank you about last night too.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.520
Tharn.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.040
Who’s that friend who was looking after you last night?

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.560
I’ve never seen him before.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.960
His name is Phaya. He’s my friend at the unit.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.480
Seems like you two are quite close, aren’t you?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.440
Because last night I noticed that.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.080
He was really worried about you.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.360
Not that close.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.680
He just likes to annoy me and get on my nerve.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.280
Go on and finish your food.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.440
Then I’ll drop you off.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.560
What!

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.720
Drop me off? Do I have to go somewhere?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.960
Did you forget that you have to fly to Nongkai today?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.360
Oh, that’s right!

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.840
If you hadn’t remind me then I’d have missed the flight for sure.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.080
Go pack your things then.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.520
Yai!

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.040
Wake up right now!

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.960
Did you forget that you have to go to Nongkai?

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.600
Nongkai.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.120
Look at her.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.200
She was giving me all ears while we were on the plane.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.360
She’s still mad with me.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.920
So, my dear brother.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.680
Help me make up with her.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.720
Or else I’d be cleaning the toilet at home during the festival this evening.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.200
Seriously…

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.120
Sand isn’t that kind of girl. She’ll forgive you soon enough.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.800
Before you said that...

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.360
make sure you look at her face first.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.640
She’s gorgeous.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.560
I know that. But she’s also very scary. I’m afraid of her.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.960
Are you guys talking about me?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.320
Of course, not.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.200
He was telling me how nice you are.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.040
And that you look really beautiful today.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.240
But you’d look even more beautiful...

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.320
if you stop being mad at him.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.960
Incredibly beautiful, my baby.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.960
Do you want some water? The weathe is quite hot.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.080
But you look even hotter.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.320
Tonight at the festival...

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.280
should we go try something delicious?

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:13.600
Okay.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.520
Like Spicy Papaya Salad...

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.480
And grilled river fish with chilled beer.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.160
My mouth is watering just by thinking of them.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.400
How would you like that, honey?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.040
Yes, I really love chilled beer.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.040
Those are all your favourites, huh?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.040
I still haven’t lectured you about last night.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.640
That you got so drunk and almost made us both miss the plane.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.560
Oh, so you remembered? Why didn’t you tell me then?

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.760
Are you blaming me now?

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.240
Is it my fault?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.800
What? Of course, not, sweetie.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.880
I was just kidding. Please forgive me. It’s all my fault.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.280
It’s my fault. Please tell me what you want me to do tonight, my baby.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.000
Please behave. We’re at the temple.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.600
Let’s go see the Abbot.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.360
Honey, wait for me too. Don’t you want some water?

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.360
I bought it from over there.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.720
Isn’t she adorable? That’s my wife.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.560
Goodmorning, Luangpor.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.600
Morning.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.360
Come a little closer. I’m happy for you two.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.200
You’re now on the special investigation team just like what you’ve wanted to.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.720
It’s all because of you, Luangpor,

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.560
that we could finally did it.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.520
You’ve always taken a great care of us.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.680
We are who we are because of you.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.560
We are so grateful to you.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.200
You did it because you already have it in you.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.480
Please take a good care of yourself from now on.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.120
Be mindful in everything you do.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.040
Never lose your awareness.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.560
Always be calm.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160
Don’t be a hotheaded.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.280
As long as he has me with him, I’ll always make sure he behaves.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.280
I’ll always make sure he behaves.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.280
You can rest assured that he’ll always be mindful.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400
Maybe you should tell that to yourself first.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.280
Whenever they are together, there’s always trouble.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.360
I agree.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.080
Totally agree.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.040
Without you...

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.360
harn would surely be more calm and always think twice.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.320
You are quick-tempered and act on impluse.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.080
Please mercy me.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.800
Darling, I got scolded again.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.240
There you go.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.840
Ouch! It really hurts, babe.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.880
Does it?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.680
Does it hurt a lot?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.760
Ouch!….

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.240
Go that way.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.920
While you’re staying here.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.200
Let me warn you about something

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.280
Make sure you often meditate and dedicate the merits to those whom you have wronged in the past.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.280
So that it would help lighten the consequences of your karma.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.360
Got it?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.200
Is he still not free from them?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.160
They’ve been after him since when he was born.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.320
That’s why he had to live at the temple.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.040
What do they want from him? Why are they so vengeful?

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.920
Are you going to Rocket Festival tonight?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.840
Absolutely. They won’t miss the chance.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.280
Do you want to go home to visit your grandma first?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.440
We can meet again this evening.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.840
’m going to stay here tonight.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.640
So that I can help take care of the Abbot.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.280
You and Yai go back first.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.720
I’ll give you a call later.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.880
Okay.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.440
We’d get going then. Goodbye, Luangpor.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.680
Stay safe, both of you.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.000
Tharn, can you do me a favour?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320
Luangpor,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.520
Why do you ask me to bring an extra set of bedding?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.040
Someone will also sleep here tonight.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.880
Go and make your bed in the pavillioin first.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.040
Okay.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.920
Phaya!

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.160
Tharn!

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.120
What on earth are you doing here?

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.680
Goodevening, Luangpor. Do you remember me?

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.480
Oh, I haven’t seen you for a long time. How are you?

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.240
I’m good.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.720
You two spent a lot of time together during the training, didn’t you recognised each other?

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.880
Do you mean, Phaya and I...

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.720
have met before we went to the training camp?

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.800
That’s right.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.800
You used to give him the amulet when he was young.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:26.920
What?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.320
You’re that boy who gave me the amulet?

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.840
Thank you so much, Luangpor.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.320
For always taking care of Tharn since the day he lost his parents in an accident.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.400
You and this temple...

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.760
have always been a sanctuary for Tharn and I.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.080
He often told me that all he has is his grandmother.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.640
So, he doesn’t want anything bad to happen to you.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.560
That’s why he asked if he could live here.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.680
I don’t want him to blame himself.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.960
I could only hope that...

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.000
he will eventually forget about that terrible accident when he gets older.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.080
Everything has already been destined.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.480
His life is written by the karma he did in his past life.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.400
Is there a way to fix it?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.200
Well, there is somehow.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:55.600
His destiny has been entwined with someone since his past life.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.480
That person will lead him to experience bad things.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.520
But it is also that person who would be able to free him from his karma.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.320
Tharn, let’s go to the festival.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.360
Tharn, it’s the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon today. Are you going to the Rocket Festival with Yai?

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.640
Yes, grandma.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.520
Please don’t worry.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.200
I’ll take a good care of myself.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.680
When the festival is done, I’ll go visit you at home.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.920
Take care of each other, okay?

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.520
Yes, grandma.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.040
- Let's help pack up
- Okay.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.480
Tharn, I need a little favour from you.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.480
Make sure you track down the owner of this amulet by tonight.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.440
Once you’ve found him, give him this amulet.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.640
Who is the owner of this amulet, Luangpor?

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.880
If you meet him, your feelings will tell you.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.080
Who is the owner of this necklace?

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.760
But you must find him.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.080
Whether you’d be free from those whom you have wronged in the past...

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.560
depends on whether you’d be able to find the owner of this amulet tonight.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.920
Let’s go.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.720
Goodbye, Luangpor.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.640
Tharn! Yai! Come quick! What took you so long? I’ve been here for a while.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.560
Let’s go.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.240
Who are you looking for?

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.640
The person that the Abbot asked me to give this amulet to.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.400
Geez, I thought you and I could just have fun at the festival.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.240
Too bad the Abbot also gave you a mission for tonight.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.160
Now, I’m bored.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.840
The Abbot said there’ll be a sign and I’ll know once I see him.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.960
The owner of this amulet.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.760
What sign?

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.560
What are you two talking about?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.160
Some nonsese stuff.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.080
Let’s light up these firecrackers. I bought tons of them.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.640
After we finish eating, let’s go watch something at the outdoor cinema.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.760
Yeah, let’s do that.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.240
- You take the meatballs to eat first.
- Okay

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.640
What’s this for?

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.720
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.040
Help! My nephew is drowning!

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.960
Tharn, what’s wrong?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.679
I saw a boy drowning.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.840
Geez, nonsense.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.679
Are you going to tell me that you have a vision?

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.320
But I really saw it.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.800
Nonsense. Let’s go watch a movie.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.760
Help! My nephew is drowning!

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.199
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:53.000
Help! My nephew! He is drowning!

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.640
Phaya!

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.360
Phaya!

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.960
Phaya!

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.360
Wake up

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.040
- Wake up
- Phaya

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.040
- Wake up
- Phaya

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040
(Choke)

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.120
(Crying sound)

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.000
Thank you

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.520
It’s okay. You’re safe now.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.040
Here are your clothes. Let’s go and get changed.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.600
- Thank you all of you so much for saving his life.
- You’re welcome.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.680
Tharn.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.000
You should go and get changed too.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.560
We’d get going then.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.200
Goodbye.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.400
Without him, my nephew would have been dead.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.120
Thank you so much indeed.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.800
Oh, it’s all right. I was quite worried when I heard about it.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.760
But what a relief to know that they were all safe.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.960
It’s probably like what you said.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.400
Your nephew is a very fortunate boy.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.200
So, he would probably live for a very long time.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.240
But you have to be careful though.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.120
If both of your destiny are entwined like what I think...

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.720
you would eventually find each other again.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.320
Please take this as a thank you gift for saving my nephew’s life.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.520
Thank you, ma’am. But my grandma and the Abbot have taught me to always help those who are in need.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.600
Hey, but you did something good so you should take it.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.120
I’ll take it then.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:41.920
Thank you.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.760
Ouch!

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.800
Well, then...I’ll give it to the Abbot instead.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.160
I’d like to donate this money for the temple and those who live here.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.360
So that you could use it as an education fund of these kids.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.320
I'm so close to getting the money,The Abbot.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.480
Are you here for the Rocket Festival?

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.240
You don’t look local though.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.160
We came from Bangkok.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.680
My nephew often dreamt about the Naga.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.800
So, he insisted that I must take him to the festival.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.880
He wants to witness it by himself.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.040
But I had no idea why he almost got drowned.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.360
He doesn’t know how to swim.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.880
But he still wants to go and play near the riverbank.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:44.880
Grandma, I really heard someone calling me there last night.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.680
I want to go home now.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.120
Well then, please excuse us.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.160
Thank you so much once again.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.000
For saving my nephew’s life.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.480
You’re welcome. Please travel safe.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.800
Thank you.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.800
Please take care.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.240
Okay.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.360
If you have a chance to visit here again in the future,

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.760
I hope we’ll meet again.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.520
Thank you.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.280
Let’s say goodbye to the Abbot.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.880
Have a safe trip.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.360
Please wait!

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.400
Here, take it.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.600
Why?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.560
The Abbot used to tell me...

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.480
to find the owner of this amulet.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.440
I think you’re that person.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.920
But I don’t want it.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.160
Take it.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.880
It will help protect you.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.040
Until we meet again.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.000
ou’re that boy I saved from getting drowned?

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.960
Geez.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.600
I shouldn’t have done that.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.080
Then we wouldn’t have to see each other again.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.800
But I’m glad

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.960
to know that you were the boy who saved my life.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.280
Why are you glad?

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.360
Well, because...

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.800
you might be the one who can help answer the questions I have about my dreams.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.120
What you saw wasn’t a dream.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.120
It was your karma

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.920
Are you saying that...

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.480
they are those whom I have wronged in my past life?

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.720
That’s right. But they are not just yours.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.840
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.080
Do you remember what I used to tell you?

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.200
hat you must find the owner of that amulet.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.240
Once you’ve found him, you must protect him with your life.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.120
Because he could help free you from your karma.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.400
It’s all up to the owner of this amulet.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.800
All these years,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.920
I’ve been trying to find the meaning of my dreams.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.640
I want to know what exactly it was...

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.800
that I saw when I was drowning.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.240
After that incident...

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.280
on every 15th day of the 11th waxing moon,

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.680
I’d always see those pictures in my dream.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.800
A pair of green eyes.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.440
These pictures became clearer and cleaer every time I saw them.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.640
From just a pair of green eyes to seeing the Naga?

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.640
Yes.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.240
Have you ever seen any of them?

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.560
No.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.040
I only saw it once when I was down there to rescue you.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.960
But those green eyes that I saw...

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.960
might have been the Naga fireballs.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.200
Everything that happens to both of you...

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.960
is a result of your karma.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.520
You’d only know the answer...

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.840
through the act of meditation which will enlighten you and lead you to the truth.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.120
Your destiny have been entwined since your past lives

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.360
มันผูกกันมาหลายภพ

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.480
You both are destined to help each other

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.760
Trust each other.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.280
Only then, you would be able to free yourself from your karma.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.640
Your kind hearts are your best weapon.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.920
And remember to always trust each other

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.760
Help each other.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.040
And you both would live a happy life,

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.880
like you’ve always dreamt of.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.760
(Thunder sounds)

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.920
I was only doing my job.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.120
Your job? Or you just wanted to intervene.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.120
I don’t want to hurt anyone.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.640
I just want to get what is mine back.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.000
(Thunder sounds)

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.920
You already know what you’ve always wanted to know.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.240
Why are you still after me?

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.920
But that’s not everything that I want to know.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.720
Tharn.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.360
Phaya.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.880
-Yai.
What on earth are you doing here?

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.960
You doing here?

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.040
I’m here to sort out something.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.040
Oh, you’ve come quite far.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:21.520
(The sound of laughter)

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520
How did he get here?

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.040
I don’t know.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.280
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Sand.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.240
Hello.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.280
Wow, you’ve got a beauty as your girlfriend, huh?

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.920
Of course. A handsome guy like me only deserves the best.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.320
Right, honey?

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.320
It was quite dark so I didn’t know he actually looks like this.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.920
(Everyone laughs)

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.320
That was harsh, honey. I’m hurt.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.440
So, welcome to Nongkai.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.920
It’s always crowded on this day of every year.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.360
Once, the traffic jam went all the way to Udon Thani.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.880
Those people probably wanted to come witness the Naga fireballs with their own eyes.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.800
So,

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.400
Are you here for the first time?

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.160
No, this is my second time.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.240
I used to come here once when I was a kid.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.880
I see.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.400
If you want to come here more often, then you should get yourself a lover in Nongkai.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.000
Right, Tharn?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.480
Do you want me to recommend someone?

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.400
My junior is still single.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.000
Thank you.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.080
Maybe Tharn, the single one...Oops! I mean...

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.960
Tharn might want to see the Naga fireballs now.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.360
Let’s go find somewhere to sit.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.040
Okay.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.240
We’ll see you at the festival then.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.240
I’m going to eat the grilled fish at my favourite restaurant first.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.480
I already made a reservation. The place is packed with people from the festival today.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.400
See you!

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.600
See you.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.440
Want some?

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.480
- See you then.
- See you

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.480
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.880
Are you ready, my guide?

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.720
Lead the way.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.360
(Music)

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.480
It’s beautiful.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.920
It’s so crowded this year.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.880
Hey, the pork here is really good.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.680
Really?

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.080
Can I have one, please?

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.600
This one and this one too. The crispy pork skin too.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.720
Thank you.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.800
Let’s go.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.640
Thank you.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.480
(Fun music)

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.440
(Fireworks sound)

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.320
Let’s go eat something after this.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.080
Okay.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.760
Are you okay?

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.840
Are you afraid of the Naga statue?

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:39.960
No

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.960
But you look so pale right now.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.080
It’s nothing. Let’s get going.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.120
(Fireworks sound)

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.280
Did you see that, honey?

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.480
Yes.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.040
There are lots of them this year.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.280
But I only saw the first one.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.960
Aww, why didn’t you pay more attention?

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.520
It’s amazing.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.360
Look over there!

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.040
Did you see it?

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:39.720
Yes,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.880
Amazing.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.760
But not as amazing as you.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.280
Where?

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.440
- Sure?
- Yeah.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.960
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.000
It was huge

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.840
Why couldn’t you see it?

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.440
Did you see that one Tharn was talking about?

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.600
- No.
- Did you fool me?

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.840
We both saw it.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.040
Sure?

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.400
Yes. See that?

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.000
Phaya, did you see it? Over there.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.240
Yes.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.320
Right in front of me

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.800
Saw that, honey?

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.560
Yes.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.760
-Yes.
-It was big.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.640
Are you feeling better?

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.200
Yeah, sort of

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.640
But you don’t look okay at all.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.120
I don’t know.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.600
I couldn’t breathe all of the sudden.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.920
And I felt the burning pain all over my body.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.560
You go enjoy the festival then.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.040
I’ll go back to the temple first.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.760
It’s okay. I’ll go back with you.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.560
Thanks.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.000
You’re so beautiful.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.200
Once upon a time, a Naga disguise itself as a man.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.560
It was long before I was born.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.600
There is no way you can help him, Wansarut.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.840
(Gasping)

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.000
(Gasping)

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.240
Why is it that every time I got near you,

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.160
I’d always have a bad dream?

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.120
Phaya,

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.720
Sand and I will give you a tour in Nongkai today.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.040
Think of it as my apology

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.080
For last nigt.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.080
It was too crowded. I couldn’t find you guys so I just stayed with my girlfriend.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.200
If you’re going to give him a tour,

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.960
why do I have to tag along?

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.640
I’m want to stay at the temple to take care of the Abbot.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.800
Ouch!….

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.480
He wouldn’t want you to stay.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.200
Otherwise, why would he tell me to take you with me too?

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.520
I’m going to take you to the cave.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.360
What cave?

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.320
I’m sure you’ll like it.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.320
It’s said that this cave is the gateway to the city of Naga.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:11.600
There are lots of stalactites and stalagmites in the cave. It would surely give you a creep.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.400
I’m having goosebumps right now thinking about last night.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.840
Why didn’t you want to tag along with us?

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.040
Or do you still want to sleep at the pavillion?

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.640
Ouch!….

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.720
Watch your mouth. We’re at the temple.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.960
Watch my mouth?

Tharn

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.080
I have to thank you though.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.160
If you hadn’t saved me on that day,

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.760
I would have been dead.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.400
It was a good thing.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.720
That I got drowned?

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.560
If I hadn’t saved your life back then,

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.120
we wouldn’t have met like this.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.120
Are you trying to hit on me?

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.120
Let’s go.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.840
I’ll take you to some other places.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.000
Where?

[Wat Tham Din Phiang]
Nong Khai Province

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.280
I think there are numerous photographs of me.
Take pictures of the Buddha there.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.640
Here we are.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.320
We got here

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.120
The Dinphiang Cave (aka Srimongkol Cave).

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.480
The local people believe that this is the path where the Naga’s daughter has to pass through.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.920
One day, she fell in love with the human prince.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.880
But on the End of Buddhist Lent Day,

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.280
She must go back to the Naga city.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.280
However, the prince had secretly followed her back.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.280
And finally found out that the woman he loved was a Naga.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.840
The prince couldn’t bare with this truth.

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.120
So, he decided to leave her forever.

This is where the people here believe to be the coffin of Indra Naga or the King of Naga.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.640
It is the coffin of Pu Innakarat.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.840
They believe that these poles help support the city of Naga.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.040
They were the pillars of the Thousand Halls that sustained the undersea city.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.760
They look amazing.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400
Incredible.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.280

Wait.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.200
What is it?

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.520
If you want to freshen up, have it with this.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.560
Thanks.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.400
I’m going to find something to eat. So hungry right now.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.960
Try this and you’ll feel fresh.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.440
Do you think I can drink it now?

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.760
Yeah.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.240
Ah, so fresh.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.920
Here, try it.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.800
Why would you put the cap on?

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.800
By the way,

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.920
I had a bad dream again last night.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.240
Again?

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.000
Yeah.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.680
What was it like?

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.200
Same old story. But this time, you were there in my dream too.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.800
Are you saying it was because of me

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.000
that you had a bad dream?

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.560
Of course, not. Forget it. Let’s go then.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.960
Where to, next?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.280
Wat Hai Sok (Nongkai province)

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.120
Wow, is this your house?

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.200
It looks really classy.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.600
I thought you said you grew up with the Abbot at the temple.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.600
This is my grandma’s place.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960
I often come to visit her.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.760
Why didn’t you stay here then? The house is big. Why did you have to trouble the Abbot?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.000
I have my own reason which I don’t have to tell you.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.520
- But if you keep pesterting, I’d say you’re being rude.
- He means you’re nosy.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.960
Guys,

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.840
please watch your mouth. We’re at his grandma’s place

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.720
Not your own home.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.520
Like you’d let me talk like that in my own home.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.600
You knew that too? But you hardly do what I ask you to do though.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.480
Sorry

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.280
Welcome home. You’ve arrived in time for dinner.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.360
I’ve prepared a feast for all of you.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.400
Hello, grandma.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.240
Hello.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.360
I miss you so much.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.240
Really?

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.320
I’m sorry I didn’t call you that often.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.840
The instructors at the camp was very strict about us using our phones.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.360
So, I....

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.800
completely forgot about me?

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.360
Grandma.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.920
He was right. It was very strict there.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.800
I could hardly find a time to call my girlfriend.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.720
Because I had to call my mistress no.1,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.760
no.2 and then no.3 first.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760
By the time I had to call Sand,

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.760
my break time was over.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.720
Is that so? You rascal.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.000
Ouch!

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.760
Didn’t you just tell us to watch our mouths while we are here?

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.320
How dare you cursed in front of her like that.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.640
You’re a bad girl.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.840
Look at him, grandma.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.880
Why didn’t you say anything to defend me?

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.320
Why should I?

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.560
I was actually going to ask her to do it on another side too.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.640
- Another side?
- You got it.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.320
On this side.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.200
Hold on. She was just kidding.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.480
She really meant it.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.600
Is this your new friend?

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.640
Why does he look so familiar?

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.840
Hello, grandma.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.080
I’m the boy who almost got drowned, the one that Tharn had rescused on that day.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.440
Huh?

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.640
Oh my goodness. It’s really you.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.400
I wouldn’t be able to recognise you if you hadn’t told me so.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.280
It’s such a coincidence.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.440
that we finally meet again after that day.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.640
After over a decade,

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.280
we finally met again at the training camp.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.160
Yes,

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.480
what a coincidence. Fascinating indeed.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.520
Are you all right, grandma?

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.680
I’m okay.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.440
Welcome, all of you.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.200
Let’s go inside.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.200
You all must be famished.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.920
Let’s eat while the food is still hot.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.080
Let’s go then.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.920
Let’s go.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.440
Darling, that area where you pinched me hurts.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.720
So, what are you and Phaya?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.920
What do you mean?

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.720
I can tell, you know? Your eyes just say it all.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.400
We’re just colleagues.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.760
- Hmm, colleagues? / - Yeah.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.640
But Yai told me that while you were at the camp,

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.760
you were quite worried about Phaya.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.720
That you cared about him a lot.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.760
Probably a lot more than friends do.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.680
Haven’t I told you...

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.200
that I don’t want to feel hurt like that anymore?

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.360
Why? Is it because he’s a guy?

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.240
Look at me and Yai.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.640
I don’t give a damn on what other people say about us.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:37.080
So, no matter how crazy or how annoying he is...

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.160
I still love him.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.640
It’s not what you think.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:52.000
Be honest. If you like him, just admit it.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.480
Just tell him how you actually feel.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.640
Why do you have to complicate things?

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.880
Just be a man and say it.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:09.480
I don’t want to put those around me in danger.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.800
Geez, you should stop blaming yourself.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
Your parents’ death was an accident.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.960
It wasn’t because of you.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.680
If what you said is true, Yai and I both love you like our own brother...

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.720
but we’re still safe and sound.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.520
It would only happen to the one I love.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.040
It has always been like that.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.200
I don’t want it to happen again.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.760
I think you’re being paranoid.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:54.080
I think you should forget all those bad things that happened to you and enjoy the present moment.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.000
Got it?

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.120
I don’t know.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.320
Since I met Phaya again,

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.800
I stared to see things.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:14.800
It’s a vision or a sign about something that will occur in the future.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.080
As if I’m supposed to know when he’s in danger.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.560
- So that I can... / - Can what?

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.399
So that I can protect him.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.240
Geez, that sounds like you’ve been cursed.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.080
That’s what I thought so.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.439
Someone wants me to see those visions...

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.000
for some unexplainable reasons.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.960
Come on, drink up. Stop thinking too much about it.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.160
- Are you serious?
- P'Yai

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.359
Please protect your son.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.399
Don’t let anything bad happen to both of them.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.760
Don’t let what the Abbot has predicted come true.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.200
Hey, are you still up?

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.520
A new hut is easier to live than an old castle.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.160
It’s actually ‘a happy hut is better than a gloomy castle.’

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.800
I was just kidding. I’m thinking about something.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
About what?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:40.160
I came here because I wanted to find out more about the Naga.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.320
Whether it’s true or not.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.440
About those legends I read from the books, or even about the Naga fireballs.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.400
Do what you believe. Believe in what you do.
(A famous saying from the movie, ‘Mekhong Full Moon Party’)

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.480
I watched that movie for so many times.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And other movies about the Naga too.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.280
The more I kept watching them...

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.280
the more I started to feel familiar with those stories.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.400
It’s really weird.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.200
I even dreamt about it too.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.520
And drew that picture in your diary.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.320
And believed that I were that girl you drew, right?

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:33.640
It’s not like that. I just feel something every time I get near you.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.520
You mean, as if we’ve met long before we did at the traning camp?

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.000
Long before you had saved my life when I was drowning.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:55.040
I feel as if we have met long before that.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.200
Did you use this kind of story to hit on the girls in France?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.520
Merci Beaucoup. (Thank you in French)

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.040
I didn’t use it with every girl that I try to hit on.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.680
I only use it with someone that I really like.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.360
And that someone is you.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.240
You evil jellyfish.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.920
Go get some sleep.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.400
French people do this to say hi and goodbye.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.880
I got it. Can I go to sleep now?

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.240
And this is called a ‘goodnight kiss’.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.840
I’m off to bed.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.520
(Yawning)

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.360
(Phone buzzing)

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.360
(Phone buzzing)

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.120
(Phone buzzing)

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.560
(On phone screen)
Evil Jellyfish

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.360
If you love him, just let him know.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.760
Tell him how you feel.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:46.680
I don’t want those around me to be in danger.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.960
Geez, stop blaming yourself.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.600
Hey, I gave you a call so many times after we came back from Nong kai,

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.320
why didn’t you answer them?

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.600
Nothing serious.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.520
Just too lazy to take the call.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.760
Are you avoiding me?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.840
Why would I do that?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.320
What the fuck?

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.720
Hang on.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.320
Why are you blocking my way?

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.800
Do you want to get hurt?

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.280
Yes, I want to get hurt.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.960
I want to get hurt so badly.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.880
So, can you tell me now why you’re avoiding me?

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.280
I’m not avoiding you.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.040
Fine.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.200
Let’s do this.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.320
Let’s have a match. If I win,

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.560
you must admit that you’re avoiding me.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.160
- Okay? / - Do you really think you can beat me?

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.840
Do you want to try?

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.800
I’m going to kick your ass.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.640
- Ready? / - Bring it on.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.280
How does it feel?

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.440
- Let me go!
- Do you give in now?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.840
I won.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.880
- One... / - Let me go!

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.400
- Get off me! / - Two...

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.920
Three...

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.600
Four...

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.080
Five...

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.480
Six, Seven...

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.720
- Eight, Nine...
- Okay, you won!

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.560
you won!

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.760
You lost.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.840
So, next time when I give you a call...

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.120
you have to answer it. Okay?

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.320
Bolster.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.840
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.680
You’re a good boy.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.480
You’ll meet the leader of Unit 1 today.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.320
This person will supervise the investigations under your team.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.320
Is it a he or a she?

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.680
This morning, I saw that the leader of Unit 3...

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.760
is a woman. She looks so cool.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.360
You guys are considered very lucky.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.040
Because your team leader is very experienced.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.960
Never failed to arrest the criminals in every case.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.960
Is that why we are Unit 1?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.680
Yes. There he is, your team leader.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.800
Attention!

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.000
Inspector.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.800
Nice to meet you all.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.160
I’m Police Major Akkanee Assawawaisoon, your team leader.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.480
Shit, we’re so doomed.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:24.640
You didn’t mention anything about being our team leader when we parted, Captain. I mean Inspector.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.640
If I had mentioned it earlier, I wouldn’t have been able to find out whether you’d be true to your words about your determination...

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.480
when you told me on the last day of the training.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.920
I can still remember it word by word.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.440
What did I say to him?

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.840
You gave him an earful.
Shit.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.680
Please keep in mind...

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.320
that this is a real workplace.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.080
You’re no longer at the traning camp.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.400
I only have three simple rules if we’re going to work together.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.080
First is teamwork.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.600
There’ll be no solo investigation.
Or doing anything without permission or approval from others.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.640
Second, the supervisor’s order is considered final...

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.840
and cannot be challenged or disobeyed.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.560
Those who do will get kicked out of the team immediately.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.240
Third, never mix business with your peronsal affairs.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.120
Every time that you are out on an investigation...

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.160
there must be no mistake.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.440
Just one false step and that would mean...
you’re throwing away justice and the truth of the case.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.800
- Got it? / - Hooya!

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.720
No need to say ‘Hooya’. This is not a training camp.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.440
I hope we’d be able to work together for a long time.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.120
And that no one would get kicked out soon.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.600
Shit. What did I say to him back then?

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.720
You were giving him an earful.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.520
- Geez, Yai.
- You too.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.920
I can’t remember what I said to him.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.920
But I’m so happy.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.200
Happy my foot.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.200
I’m so dead.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.280
- Put all the information on the screen. / - Yes, sir.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.560
Come in.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.800
- Please take a seat. / - Yes, sir.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.840
Inspector, the information you’ve asked for is ready.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.160
Give it to the team.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.800
This is Lieutenant Singh. He’s one of our team.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.680
He’d help support you on the IT part.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.040
Hello.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.880
I’m Lieut Singh, the IT officer.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160
Pleased to work with you.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.760
That one is Wit.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.000
He’s the forensic officer.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.120
This is your first case.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.440
The rapist murder.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.840
I heard about his case whileI was at the camp.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.560
Both victims were charged with rape.
Their bodies were shot and hung up by the necks.
Their genitals were also cut off.
That’s what I heard.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.400
That’s right. Now, we have the third victim.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:49.120
The first victim was a 45-year-old male. The name is Ohm.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:57.280
He was beaten up and his tongue got cut off.
We found evidence of torturing with candles. His genital was cut off.
He was charged with raping his stepchild and was released less than 2 weeks before he got killed.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.280
The next victim...

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.120
is Chin, a 30-year-old male.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.960
Similar condition to the first victim.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.480
This one was charged with harrassing a woman who dressed up sexily.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.280
The investigation was still on going but he got killed first.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.560
The third victim’s body was found yesterday.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:20.280
A 55-year-old male. The name is Korn.
His charge for sexually assault was dismissed because there wasn’t a solid evidence.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.800
The cause of death was similar to that of the first two victims.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.080
They all have the same cause of death.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:32.200
Is this a serial murder case then?

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.120
But the police still couldn’t find the genitals that were cut off.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.640
So, they decided to forward this case to us for further investigation.
In hope that we could have this case closed as soon as possible.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.240
The time limit is within one week.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.320
We don’t want to alarm the citizens about this case.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.160
Inspector.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.880
The police spent months investigating on this case and they still couldn’t close it.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.480
Will we be able to do it just within one week?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.040
We still have no idea who the killer is.
The killer just turned himself in this morning...

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.360
and already confessed to everything.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.760
Oh, so the killer is caught.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.800
Why bother giving us this case?

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.440
There are three of them who turned themselves in.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.280
Each claimed that they were the killer.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.600
But that they didn’t do it intentionally.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.240
They were forced to kill.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.000
idolfactory

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.320
Why don’t you go back home and sleep on your bed? Wouldn’t it feel more comfy?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.960
I want to sleep on the same bed with you.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.040
Or do you not like that?

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.600
Be careful, boy. The person you have wronged in the past is coming after you.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:04.120
They are somewhere close to you. Don’t let them take him away from you.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.640
Stop!

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:38.120
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:54.080
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:04.040
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:19.440
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:26.720
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.920
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:38.880
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
