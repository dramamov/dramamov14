Wit.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.360
He is Rin’s boyfriend,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.560
Narong’s sister who committed suicide.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.760
Stop!

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.160
The laws that you respect and look up to...

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.000
can never keep those bastards behind bars for long.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.560
Songyod is arrested.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.080
I tried to ask Narong about the thing that happened in the cellar today.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
It seems he had no idea what was happening to him.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.120
Is there anyone who can tell us about what we saw?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.160
You should know where you stand
and better stay by his side as a big brother.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.640
I’ll try to keep that in mind.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.600
Until your time is done.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.200

The Sign

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.920
We finally meet again.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.960
Who are you?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.320
Why are you always in my dream?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.800
Don’t you remember me?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.040
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440
And you’ll finally see.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.200
Phaya.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.240
Phaya, are you okay?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.120
I’ve been calling for ages.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.360
Grandma said dinner is ready.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.680
If you don’t want her to get even more upset, you better hurry up and come down.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.640
Okay, I’ll be right behind you.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.120
Tharn.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.200
Yes?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.440
Where are you?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.000
Swimming at my condo.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.840
With whom?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.280
Khem and Thongthai. Yai is on the way.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.880
What’s the matter?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.440
I had a bad dream about you so I was just worried.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.680
Don’t worry. I can take care of myself.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.040
But I’m really worried this time.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
Maybe you should take some days off for a while.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.320
Think of it as a rehab for your injury.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.960
You can get back to work once you’re fully recovered.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360
Are you saying that I should tell the Inspector...

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.880
that I need to take leave because of your bad dream?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.560
Are you nuts?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.920
Tharn.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.200
This is not different from when I doubted about your vision.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.080
But right now I won’t deny what you are seeing.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.760
Yes, it might be just a dream.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.920
But the fact that I keep dreaming about it again and again...

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.520
and you are always in those dreams,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.920
don’t you think it’s actually the same as your vision?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.600
You don’t need to worry about me.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.960
I’ll take a good care of myself, okay?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.880
Bye.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.040
Wait. Tharn! Tharn!

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.200
Hey, where are you going?
Grandma will bite your head off if you leave now.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.280
I have something urgent to take care of.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.200
Hang on. You’re acting weird.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.280
Is it about someone? Who is it?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.200
Just a friend.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.640
- My colleague.
- Hmmmm

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.800
He probably needs my help with his work.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200
Are you sure he’s just a friend?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.840
Why do you have to rush out like this? Why can’t you just give him a call?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.200
I already did but he didn’t pick up.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.400
- Why are you being so nosy, cheeky monkey?
- Ouch!

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.680
I’m leaving.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.920
Hello, Phaya.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.840
And this is...

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.720
This is Nee, my little sister. Do you remember her?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.440
I see...

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.800
I haven’t seen you for a while. You’ve grown into a beauty.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.640
Hello, Dao.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.400
Oh, you’re here? That was quick.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.560
Hello, Grandma.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.280
I can’t believe someone like Phaya...

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.120
would be so superstitious about his bad dream like this.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.280
Hey, are you and Phaya together?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.760
What?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.240
Of course, not.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.200
Well, he seems to worry about you a lot.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.960
Probably a lot more than just a colleague would do.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.280
He was having a bad dream about you and it worries him to death.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.360
I’m sure the power of love he has for you is very immense, my bro.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.240
Shut up, you jerk.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.760
Listen.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.799
Phaya and I are just colleagues. That’s it.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.799
If you don’t like him that way...

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.039
why do you always have to protect him?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.400
You even took the stab for him.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.000
Before you’d say anyting,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.040
I want to use your heart rather than your head.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.920
Awww….

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.400
Stop. I already told you guys and we are just friends.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.000
- Swear? / - Would you swear?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.600
- Go on. Swear it.
- Would you swear?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.360
What?

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.520
I’d rather not.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.000
What if Phaya likes you then? What would you say?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.200
Yeah, what would you do?

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.760
Will you give him a chance?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.560
Come on, say it.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.640
I think you’re imagining things.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.280
The way Phaya behaves when he’s around you…

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.640
I used to be like that too.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.160
Geez, what’s wrong with you?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.760
For Baby and I,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.560
our relationship also started from me always caring for him.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.080
Geez, stop it. It wasn’t an act of caring at all.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.240
It actually started with a chaos.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.720
The first time I saw you,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.760
I almost wanted to quit the university.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.600
What happened?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.000
Tell us then. I really want to know.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.720
Well, our relationship began to bloom...

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.200
on the day when our young hearts were still yearning for love.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.520
With my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.800
It was the beauty of my young and muscular body…

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.160
that made him fallen for me.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.000
You have a pose as well.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.320
Can you get to the point now? I’m listening.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.400
Well, it all started like this…

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.440
[A university in the north]

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.280
[2009]

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.200
(Screaming)

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.680
(Screaming)

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.360
Definitely me.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.640
Shit!

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.920
Is there anyone?

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.920
Hey, are you done? Do you need a hand?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.480
Wow, they look cute on you.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.760
I’ll wash them and return them to you later.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.560
No worry. I’ll take care of your wet clothes too.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.040
Think of it as my apology.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.160
I’m leaving then.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.760
Hey, wait.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.760
I have a question.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.840
Do you believe infinity?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.200
What?

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.920
Infinity. Isn’t that what you call something like fate?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.960
You know?

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.600
That’s ‘Destiny’.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.560
Huh?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.760
Look at my lips.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.320
- Des... / - Des...

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.600
- Ti... / - Ti...

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.080
- Ny. / - Ny.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.360
- Destiny.
- Tishni.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.360
No. DESTINY.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.400
Tishni

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.040
Stop it.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.400
Then what does that sentence I just said mean?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.320
How can you not know the meaning of what you said?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.480
It means whether or not you believe that destiny exists.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.560
I see.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.920
Actually, I know what it means.
I just want you to ask me the same thing too

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.760
But if you ask me, I do.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.040
Because it was my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight…

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.880
and the beauty of my young and muscular body,
that have brought us together.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.320
Wow, that sounds so romantic. I’m so good at it.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.360
Well done to myself.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.720
Don’t you find it romantic?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.600
Please excuse me.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.480
- See you. / - Bye.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.200
Oh, wow.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.200
Romantic , wasn’t it?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.040
So cheeky.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.760
I thought I was watching ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.120
You two seem to get off on the wrong foot.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.040
How come you ended up dating each other?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.400
Well, after that day...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.160
I kept following him to offer my sincere apology.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.880
But the more time I spent with him,
the more I started to have feelings for him.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.840
So I decided to go after him.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.880
Hi, baby.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.240
Are you...?

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.720
Yes. I mean you, baby.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.400
Here you go.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.280
I already washed them. They smell so nice.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.560
If you don’t believe me, then I’ll show you.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.280
You idiot! That’s my underpants. Why did you smell it?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.840
What is it?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.480
Your clothes. Please take them back.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.120
I’d be going then.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.000
Wait.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.880
Let’s find something to eat. It’s on me.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.360
When will you stop bothering me?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.280
How can I do that? We’re not even together yet.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.040
I’m sorry but I don’t like men.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.560
Why don’t you go after those junior girls who admire you?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.240
Hey, wait.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.240
I just want to know you as a friend.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.840
I already sent you an invitation. Will you accept it?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.680
If not, you’d be so rude though.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.240
Judging from your look,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.840
you seem to be quite educated.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.960
So, I guess you won’t be so rude to me.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.600
Do you really want to get to know me that much?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.160
Why don’t you give me a chance to get to know you?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.120
Maybe, if you do...

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.680
and we have some time to get to know each other,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.560
you and I might turn out to be a perfect match.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.280
As friends, I mean.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.720
Or maybe when we get to know each other more,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.160
you might fall head over heels for me.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.120
Why are you being so persistent?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.920
Because I am Khem.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.880
I’m Thongthai.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.760
Woo-hoo!

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.000
What are you doing?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.560
I don’t like wasting time. Can we skip some steps?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.440
We’re now close.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800
Let’s go find something to eat.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.640
Tonight, I’m going to make you get to know me even more.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.280
Every part of me.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.000
Okay. But let me warn you that my standard is pretty high.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.000
If it turns out to be below my standard, you have to leave me alone.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.640
Well, if you say so.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.400
You got it.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.720
How was it, baby? Sexy?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.200
Respect, respect, respect.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.840
So, you guys just skipped the talk and went straight to sex.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.080
Why so hurry?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.480
Well, if we’re going ot be in a relationship,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.720
we’d have a lot more time to talk later on anyway.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.160
I’d rather do that thing first.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.360
So that I’d know if we both are on the same page. I don’t want to waste time.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760
By the way,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.400
I won’t mind if you’d also adopt my method.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.440
You’ll find out right the way...

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.040
whether you two are made for each other or not.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.560
I don’t need to do that.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.880
Because I still insist that I don’t like Phaya that way.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.960
Awww, he’s stubborn.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.000
He just ran.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.120
Or maybe he probably meant it, that he doesn’t really have feelings for Phaya.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.080
He might already like someone else.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.640
Is it me?

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.320
Obviously not.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.440
That was hard.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.040
Let’s brainstorm.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.000
We hardly have any case to work on these days.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.160
Yeah.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.760
Let’s find some time and go on a trip together.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.160
Maybe it would help Tharn and Phaya...

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.200
to get closer to each other when they are both naked.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.720
Eat this! So that you can keep your mouth shut.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.000
Geez! What the fuck!

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.560
Damn you.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.000
Yai.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.120
Has Tharn ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend before?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.160
Yes, but that person was dead.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.480
- Dead? / - Yes

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.120
So, he’s afraid. He doesn’t want to get hurt like that again.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.520
These fruits are fresh from the market.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.320
My aunt asked me to send her best regards to you.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.160
Thank you.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.800
- That one is for Phaya.
- Thanks a lot.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.720
Phaya is injured from work again.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.280
So, my aunt told me to pay a visit as soon as I can.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.800
It seems like you had already known beforehand that he’d be injured.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.840
Well, that day when I went to see him at the unit,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.560
I remember he was also injured from work.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.760
I had a hunch that someone hot-tempered like him
would eventually get himself injured again.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.200
Well, I’m fine now.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.760
That’s why I didn’t tell you. I don’t want to bother you or anyone else.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.800
Whether it’s a big or small injury, our parents will always be worried about us.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.000
Grandma, I think we should ask him to quit being a cop.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.080
He has just started working and look how often he got injured.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.600
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop him since it’s the job that he likes.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.240
I don’t like to force anyone to do something against his will.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.800
He’s free to do whatever he loves...

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.640
as long as it’s not so dangerous that he has to risk his life for it.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.400
I totally agree with you.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.480
You can do any job you like.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.040
But you must also have a work-life balance.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.720
Don’t devote yourself to work so much that you forget
to care about those around you, or someone close to you.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.680
Do you agree?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.960
If you really love your job as a police officer,
maybe you should find someone to take care of you.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.360
So that he or she can look after you when you get injured again.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.440
Well, he has both Grandma and I to look after him.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.160
So, you don’t have to worry about that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.920
Nee, listen to me.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.800
You also need to live your own life.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.840
You can’t spend your whole life looking after your big brother.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.480
Unless you don’t want to have anyone.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.880
Please excuse me for being rude.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.600
But I was wondering if you’re already taken?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.640
Well...

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.280
Taken? A naughty girl like her?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.920
Obviously, not.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.960
Thank you so much for your concern about me though.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.840
All right then. Let’s start eating. We’ve been chatting for quite some time.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.000
Okay.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.800
Eat this too, Grandma.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.760
You should eat more so that you’d get better soon.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.520
Thank you.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240
Thanks.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.960
You should eat more too.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.200
You probably didn’t get to eat Thai food that often when you were abroad.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.400
Oh, but I actually did. I worked part-time at a Thai restuarant.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.720
Grandma.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.520
My aunt told me that you will also attend the art exhibition. Is that right?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.840
Yes. Your aunt called and invited me by herself.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.080
Will Phaya be there too?

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.760
My aunt said you’ll also take him with you.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.040
Ah, that’s right.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.480
Can you please come with me? My friends really want to see you.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.080
You hardly go anywhere with me these days.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.800
All you do is work.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.200
Well...I...

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.040
Of course, Grandma. I’ll go with you.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.120
I’m also free.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.000
Can I go too?

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.160
Of course.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.400
Can’t he just at least send me a sticker?

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.160
(Door scratching)

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.280
(Door scratching)

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.400
Nee?

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.040
What’s the matter?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.280
I bring you some fruits that Dao gave us.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.760
Hmm, are you really my sister?

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.280
Why are you so kind today?

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.680
This is all you’d get to eat. The rest is mine.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.280
Thanks a lot. Put it over there. I’ll eat them soon.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.560
Aren’t you done? Go back to your room then.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.600
I’m not in a hurry.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.120
Your room looks so comfy today.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.040
What?

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.120
Eat this first.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.120
Eat it.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:15.960
What is it?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.160
I’ll get to the point then.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.920
Okay.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.280
How close were you and Dao when you two were studying abroad?

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.040
Grandma asked me to take care of her because she’s the favourite niece of her best friend. That’s all.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.360
Have you and Dao ever been together?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.640
You are quite a player. So, I think it’s possible.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.120
- Geez, you monkey. / - Ouch.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.640
That’s enough.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.440
Just answer my question so that I can be at ease.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.520
No, Dao and I are like brother and sister.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.280
Okay, I feel better now.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.720
What’s wrong with you, Miss Paranee?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.320
Why are you so interested in Dao?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:17.360
Well, she is beautiful and seems to know you well.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.360
Our Grandma seems to like her a lot too.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.560
So, I just want to know more about her.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.360
That’s all.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.200
She and you would probably make a perfect couple though.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.920
I mean, consdisering all other factors.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.040
She’s actually too good for someone like you.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.400
But good enough for you, right?

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.040
What?

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240
What?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.920
Don’t try to be a shipper.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.040
I’m leaving.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.840
You’re changing the subject.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.000
Namami. Where’s Namami?

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.120
Where’d he go?

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.760
Who’s this girl?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.960
And this guy too.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.520
Hmm, that girl is the one I often dream of.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880
That guy is my colleague.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:32.640
Ahh, is he the one you were rushing out to see this evening?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.120
Yeah.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.920
I just feel that these two have something in common.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.440
Huh? But this girl is just someone from your dream.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.640
That’s right.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.520
Hang on. Are you saying that you’re worried about your colleague whose name is Tharn?

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.520
So much that you try to relate him with a girl you often see in your dream?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.760
Is this the answer you’ve always been looking for?

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.120
To find out who or what it is that you saw when you were drowning.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.200
Nee.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.120
Is your friend, Wi, still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.920
The one you used to say she was cute?

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.360
Yeah.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:33.360
When we last talked, she said she would quit to open an art gallery.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120
Why?

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.120
Are you sure?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.800
Yes, I am. My gallery has never bought or displayed this kind of art.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.720
But I was told that it was sold here.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.720
I’d still insist that my gallery has never bought that kind of art.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.240
You can search the gallery if you want to.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.280
You’re not lying to me, aren’t you?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.640
No, I’m not lying.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.600
Hey.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.120
Phaya.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.320
Wi.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.080
How are you doing?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.280
I’m good.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.280
Long time no see.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.440
It’s been over a year, I think.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.480
I’m sorry for a sudden visit. I also come empty-handed.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.080
By the way, that man looks very suspicious.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.920
He’s looking for his artwork.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.800
He said his girlfriend sold it to my gallery.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.240
But I’ve never bought any artwork from his girlfriend.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.240
This happens a lot in the art industry.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760
Stealing someone else’s works and sell them.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.600
Some are rare antiques which the owners have no idea how valuable they are.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.280
Those with a keen eye would buy them and resell at a much higher price.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.480
When the owners of the work found out, they often came out to claim their rights of ownership.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.040
But some of them are forged. They are fake ones.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.080
You can hardly tell them apart from the original works though.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.360
It sounds quite complicated but I got it somehow.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.640
There’s always a story hidden behind each artwork.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.200
Each has its own unique value, method, and expertise...

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.960
depending on the artist who has created that piece of work.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.800
Those are what make the artwork valuable.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:22.640
Is this why you decided to quit teaching at the university and open an art gallery instead?

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.120
Not really.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.040
Why do you come to see me? Is there anything I can help?

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.200
If it were told by someone else, I wouldn’t have believed a word.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.160
That all your dreams seem to be connected.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.000
Do you have any idea now that you have seen my sketches?

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:08.040
Archaeology is the study of human past through landscapes, architectures, and other material remain...

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.840
with traces of culture in the past.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.199
These are, however, what you saw in your dreams.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.440
I can’t believe they can be connected into a story like this.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:24.920
But what about the legend about Naga or the fireballs
which you can see on every 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.800
There are records and traces found that it actually happened, aren’t there?

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:34.560
But those are proves for a living creature which is not human being.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.639
It’s just a legend told among the locals.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:43.440
Even for the Garuda. There’s hardly any record on this half-human and half-bird creature.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.560
Most are just stories found in the religious mythology…

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.199
which cannot be proofed whether it’s true or not.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.320
So, I’m afraid I can’t help you much with this.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.800
I only say it from my point of view.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.800
It might actually exist.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.640
Like energy forces, souls, or miracles.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.400
They are things that science can’t proof.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.160
But there are stories told about them.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.200
Someone had witnessed those things and record what they saw.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.120
Can you tell me where to find more information about it?

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.800
There’s a corner in my gallery where I keep all the records on ancient history.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.920
You can try looking in that room.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.520
You might find something useful there.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:33.920
(Mysterious Sound)

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.120
(The sound of bookshelves shaking)

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.640
King Garuda, why are you here?

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.680
Why did you help me?

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.320
You were still alive so I decided to help.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.280
On the 15th day of the 11th month...

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:50.520
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants will present their offerings and breathe out the fireballs as an act of worship.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.000
Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.600
Yes.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.280
So beautiful.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.360
I can’t go with you.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.640
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.760
Master Sakunanoparuj, this way.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.720
Phaya!

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.520
Phaya!

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.200
Phaya!

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.600
What happened?

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.440
Ouch.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.680
I was trying to get the book and the pile just tumbled down.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.960
Are you all right?

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.920
Yeah.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.600
I ran here as soon as I heard the noise...

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.600
and saw you lying unconcious on the floor.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.960
It took quite some time to wake you up. I was so worried.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.040
I’m so sorry. Your room is a mess now.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.960
- Let me help you tidy up.
- It’s all right.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.680
Ouch!

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.040
(The Son of Naga City Governor)

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.000
Wi, can I borrow this book for a while?

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.040
Sure.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.080
Thank you.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.720
Oh, hello Doc. Why didn’t you tell me you’d be here today?

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320
My patient just cancelled the appointment.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.040
So, I’m thinking maybe we could go out for dinner.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.040
Do you want to join me?

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.680
Sure. Please come and wait in my room first.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.480
I’ll go get changed.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.520
Okay.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.640
Please come in.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.120
Where are you going?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.640
He’s going to have dinner with me.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.680
Do you need anything?

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.360
I’m afraid he can’t go with you now.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.800
Because he’s coming with me.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.240
Come with me, Tharn.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.480
Hang on.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.720
Did I say I’d go with you?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.080
But I have something important to talk to you.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.160
You have no rights to force him.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.520
This is outside of your working hours.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.480
My job is to take care of him.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.000
But I don’t want to go with you.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.080
Do you remember when I warned you that you might be in danger?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.880
I told you to stay beside me so that I can protect you.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.800
But I’m going with Doc. It’s not dangerous at all.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.640
Tharn.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.120
If you are really worried about him...

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.160
you’d better stay away from him.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.680
The closer you get to him,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.800
the more danger he’d be in.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.960
The one who actually puts him in danger...

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.320
is probably not me.
But I think it is.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.640
Since the day you met him, he has to risk his life to save you for so many times.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.880
If he were to die,

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.920
you’re most likely to be the cause of it.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.160
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Ouch!!

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.320
Just because he thinks of you as his big brother...

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.360
doesn’t mean that I’d be afraid of you.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.920
I don’t really give a fuck about anything!

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.200
Phaya!

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.440
You mark my words.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.760
I will do everything to keep you two apart.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.200
I will take him away from you.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.080
Even if he has to die.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.200
What the fuck!!
(Punching)

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.240
Are you all right?

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.200
Tharn, come with me.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.800
Come with me, Tharn.
Let me go!
(Punching)
Ouch!

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.760
What’s wrong with you?!

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.600
Let’s go.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.000
Damn it!

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.960
I’m so sorry that he hurt you.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.320
It’s okay. He’s probably very worried about you.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.640
I don’t know what’s got into him.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.360
But it makes me want to stay away from him from now on.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.880
This is the floor plan of the art exhibition at the BACC.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.960
It’s for the mission that I’ve informed you earlier.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.880
I need a volunteer for this mission.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.440
Our job is to protect the important people who would attend the event.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.360
This is a special mission.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.680
It’s not an order from the authority.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.560
That’s why I’m looking for a volunteer.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.600
Raise your hand if you want to volunteer.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.040
Are you listening?

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.440
I asked if you were listening.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.400
He asked if you were listening to what he just said.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.440
I didn’t. But I was reading your lips.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.600
You want some volunteers to work on a special mission which is not an order from the authority.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.840
Their job is to protect the important people at the exhibition.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.440
Those who want to volunteer please raise their hands.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.960
(Clapping)
Wow!

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.440
You’re like a bugging device.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.280
Then I’ll assume everyone already understood what the mission is.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.840
Give me the name list once it’s done.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.920
I want to do it.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.240
I don’t think it’d be just a simple bodyguard job.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.760
I agree.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.960
It’s very strange.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.280
Our unit has never taken any job like this before.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.960
I’m sure there must be something behind this.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.760
We are not allowed to reveal our identity as an IDF officer too.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.160
It’s going to be so interesting.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.360
You get to dress up nicely.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.080
And work at a nice building.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.560
After work, I will keep the suit on and take Sand to dinner at...

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.400
the food stall in the gas station.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.400
Yeah. And order a spicy minced pork salad with lots of blood.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.360
Geez, you eat it yourself then. You got me carried away.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.400
You seem to be in a lovey dovey mode.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.640
Obviously.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.720
- Are you in then?
- Of course.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.720
- Singh, are you in?
- Yeah.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.320
- If my babe is going then I’ll go too.
- (Sigh)

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.200
Are you going, Mayris?

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.360
No, Inspector probably wants me to find out more information on the Lieutenant Tam’s case.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.240
Okay.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.560
Lieut Tam’s case?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.160
I thought the authority has ordered to have this case closed.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.600
They have.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.000
But the Inspector wants us keep investigating.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.440
Because Lieut Tam’s body might lead us to the major drug trafficking network backed up by politicians.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.600
Lieut Tam died in the line of duty.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:16.840
Huh?

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.120
You guys didn’t know about this?

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.000
Ahh, you came later.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.440
Apart from being a coach at our unit,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.720
Lieut Tam also had another important job in our IDF unit.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.040
He was one of the best spies we’ve ever had.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.960
And he was also the Inspector’s right-hand man.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.120
His mission was to track down the international drug trafficking network...

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.840
of which Minister Montree is believed to be the man behind it.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.040
Songyod is also one of his minions.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.480
He’s actually the Minister’s hand and foot.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.800
Then why can’t we just go question Songyod and force him to tell us...

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.120
information that could help destroy Minister Montree’s network?

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.440
Our IDF unit’s main job is to investigate.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.120
The execution of judgement…

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.760
or determination of punishment is the authority’s job.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.560
- Which we cannot...
- We cannot cross the line, right?

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.760
Just like many cases in the past that were treated unfairly.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.960
Yeah, including your the case about your parents too.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.480
It’s a way to force us to go forward…

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.800
but with a rope around our neck.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.400
They only allow us to walk in the direction that they are approved of.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.480
Fake freedom, you mean?

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.160
Well then, I won’t be joining you guys this time.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.040
I have a more important job to do.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.360
(Sigh)

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.200
I’m in.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.160
Then go and ask Phaya too.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.600
I think he probably wants to join us too.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
You go and ask him yourself.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.400
Yai.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.360
When did they quarrel?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.760
Was it at his condo?

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.800
Do you really want to know?

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.160
It’s my job to know about other people’s businesses.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.480
Then you go and ask him. I don’t want to mention it.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.480
Geez! You two are the same.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.600
I’ll ask baby then.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.160
Baby, Tharn and…

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.920
Stop. You’re bothering me. Go away.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.120
- That’s a lot.
- Yeah.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.760
Inspector never disappoints us. His special mission is so cool.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.680
I don’t want to hold a gun tonight.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.800
I’d rather hold her instead. Oops!

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.680
If you don’t want to spend a night in a coffin, you’d better quit playing around.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.680
- Baby.
- Good luck.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.240
- I’ll go check on the other side.
- Okay.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.520
If you are mad at him, you should clear it up with him when he comes to work tomorrow.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.080
I don’t have anything to say to him.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.360
Nothing to say? But your face already said it all.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.880
He did that because he was worried about you.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.200
Hey, Yai. Tharn.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.880
You guys are here too?

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.560
Phaya? What on earth are you doing here?

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.120
I’m a guest.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.600
This is my grandmother and my little sister.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.960
- Hello. / - Hello.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.920
Inspector has asked our team to help taking care of the security at the event.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.520
Excuse me? Are you Tharn?

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.560
It’s been a long time since we last met. Do you still remember me?

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.920
Of course, I do.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.720
Phaya only told me that he met a friend who saved his life when he was a kid.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.160
I didn’t know that you also work at the same unit. The world is round indeed.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.480
Well, it might not be because the world is round...

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.560
but rather a destiny that brought these two together.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.200
Ouch.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.200
- Um... / - Ouch.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.120
I can remember your face but not your name.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.840
- This is Yai, Grandma.
- You’re...

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.280
- Yes.
- Another kid at the temple who also saved me that day.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:31.360
Oh, I see. Now that all of you live in Bangkok, we should see each other more often.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.800
Please come to my place for a meal whenever you’re free.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.680
I’d like to treat you both to a meal as a thank you for saving my grandson.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.680
Thank you very much, Grandma.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.640
I’m afraid we have to get back to work now.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.200
Go on, dear.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.760
- Goodbye. / - Goodbye.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.640
See you.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.760
- Grandma, please wait here for a second. I’ll be right back.
- Okay.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.720
Tharn.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.440
Can we talk?

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.360
You guys talk then.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.480
You can do it!

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.600
What is it?

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.720
Well, about that night...

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.120
I’m sorry.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.720
The one you should apologise to is him not me.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.520
But the one I care about is you.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.160
Why do you have to mention him?

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.520
Phaya.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.560
When did you arrive?

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.040
My aunt is looking for you.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.920
Where are Grandma and Nee?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.680
Is this your colleague?

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.080
- Hello. / - Hello.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.200
- I’ll go then. / - Hey.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.440
Tharn!

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.160
Grandma and Nee are over there.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.520
Please excuse me. I’ll go talk to my colleague first.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.000
Tharn.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.720
Doc? You’re here too?

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.880
I got invited.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.440
It’s an exhibition displaying artworks which reflect on the human’s state of mind.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.880
- Let’s go inside then.
- Okay.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.680
Whom is Phaya talking to?

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.720
Is that the girl who came to see him at the unit?

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.240
Doctor Chalothorn.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.040
Yes?

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.120
Someone wants to see you over there.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.800
Okay.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.280
I’m leaving then. I’ll call you after the event.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.120
Okay.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.800
This way, please.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.960
Probably just a friend.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.880
He’s still single, isn’t he?

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.440
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.440
Hmm, are you sure?

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.360
Look at your face first.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.760
Your face and eyes just say it all.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.440
Tell me honestly,

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.280
why would you resist your own feelings?

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.000
Love is love.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:40.560
I want to see you happy again, Tharn.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.720
I want to see you smile like you used to.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.360
If you’re afraid that loving him would put him in danger,

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.680
I’ll also help you protect him.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.600
No need.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.360
I’ll do it because I want to see my brother happy.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.440
Got it?

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.200
Don’t forget to remind the others to keep an eye on the artworks too.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.440
(Something drops)

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.000
I’m sorry.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.520
It's OK.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.000
What a pleasure to meet you again, Inspector.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.920
Hello, Mr. Montree.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.800
Have we met before? You look so familiar.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.640
Let me remind you again that your job today...

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.520
is to protect the safety of important guests who attend the event.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.160
Arghhhh!!!

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.440
Love doesn’t exist. They are all lies.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.400
You must pay for what you did.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:02.920
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:10.360
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:18.720
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:28.880
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:36.600
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.040
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.200
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:51.640
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:55.880
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:03.800
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
