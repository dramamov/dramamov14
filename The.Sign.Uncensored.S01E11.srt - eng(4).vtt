00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Today, we've got to get all the information we can.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.800
Bing go

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.080
Tharn, do you really think Montree is the one behind your father’s death, as well as Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s deaths?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.120
Inspector already knew. Why didn’t he tell us the truth?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.000
Or maybe, he’s one of Montree’s lackeys?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680
Inspector, do you know my father?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920
Your father was betrayed by someone in his unit.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.120
Your father’s team leader.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.560
We’ll stay here for a week.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.160
We’ll be staying at Tharn’s grandma’s place.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.720
Khem, hurry up and go to Ning’s house.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.840
What did you say? Ning is dead?!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.640
She didn’t leave us any evidence and we couldn’t help her somehow.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.360
How many times does it have to be like this?!

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520
Gather as many artworks as you can.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.800
This time, it’s going to be a big one. Once you get them, send them to our warehouse in Nongkai.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.960
[Montree is heading to NongKai, where the NongKai forest produces medicine along the Mekong River.]
It’s one of our workers who went into the woods to collect wild products.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.240
Kai – he was eaten by the Tiger-man.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.800
Where’s his body right now?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.600
According to the report, the area along the bank of Mekhong river, especially between Thailand-Laos birder,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.600
is often used as the route to smuggle in drugs from Laos to Thailand...

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.680
...via the natural border path.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.360
Smugglers also pay local people to load drugs into their boats and secretly made landfall in Thailand.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.280
There are amphetamine, Ice, and also heroin.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.560
We suspect that the place where Montree and his gang use as a shelter and a hub in producing drugs…

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.080
is around the area of national reserved forests in Nongkai.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.320
In this wipe-out mission, we’d be working closely with the forest rangers and the navy force.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.400
The forest rangers will assist us during our search in the forest.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.360
The navy force will help provide a backup force during our arrest.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
Inspector, aren’t you going to include Phaya and Tharn in this mission?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.000
That’s right, Inspector.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.840
I think Tharn wants to be included in this mission too.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440
He’s already in Nongkai, staying at his grandmother’s place.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.960
Should I call him?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.040
You know better than anyone how badly Tharn wants to arrest Montree

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.760
Please give him a chance.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.600
Go and get ready.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.800
We’ll leave to Nongkai tomorrow.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.680
Yes, sir!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.520
Yai, you stay.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.760
Yes, sir.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.160
I want to know how Tharn knew that Ning was going to get killed.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.800
Well, that’s because...

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.480
he can see a vision or a sign of what’s going to happen.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.520
The sign?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.640
Yes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.320
After his accident with his parents,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.400
he started to see all these signs and visions...

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.200
including ones about our cases.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
He’s been having a vision ever since.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.480
I’m going to give you one last chance to tell me the truth, Yai.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.160
I ‘am’ telling you the truth, Inspector.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.680
Tharn can see what’s going to happen beforehand. I really mean it.

The Sign

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.960
Kham, you have to tell me everything.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.160
I have told you everything that I know.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.640
And they are all the truth.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.320
Didanyone go into Joe’s room last night?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.960
Umm, I don’t know.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.320
It looks like his room was ransacked.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.920
Joe is not a tidy person. His room is often in a mess.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.680
He’s untidy and not hygienic.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.400
He doesn’t like to mingle. We barely know him.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.440
What are you two looking for?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.640
What are you two looking for?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.400
What are you two looking for?

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.440
I’m looking for drugs. Joe’s test result reveals that he has drugs in his body

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.680
Grandma told me you’re the leader here, taking care of all the workers and looking after the sawmill.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.600
Don’t you know that Joe uses drugs?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.080
Not a clue.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.280
I barely know him.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.440
What does a Tiger-man look like? Can you show me?

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.440
Absolutely not. He’s scary.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.800
He’s half human half ghost. He can transform into a tiger.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.800
I’d rather not talk abou it anymore. It’s so scary. I’m off to bed then.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.800
Hey, why did you try to get on his nerves?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.280
We still need more information from him.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.600
Well, so that I could get some information.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.160
Look here.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.960
Why are these footprints in Joe’s room?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.120
He doesn’t like to mingle. We barely know him.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.960
He’s untidy and not hygienic.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.560
What are you two looking for?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.360
You heard what he said.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.480
Joe hardly talks to anyone.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.960
Then why there are Kham’s footprints in Joe’s room.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.640
I think he’s hiding something from us.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.600
Tharn, go and look upstairs.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.640
- Found anything?
- No.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.080
(Door unlocking)

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.360
Hey, come and have a look here.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.520
(Exciting sound)

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.160
This definitely has something to do with drugs like what you think.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.400
Then we must hurry up and find the body of that worker.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.680
We can use it as an evidence to arrest Kham.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.360
Why are you calling Chalothorn?

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.560
I’m going to ask him about giving our workers a drug test.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.200
Can’t you call some other doctors instead?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.880
But I only trust Doc.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.920
But I don’t trust him.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.000
Phaya, give me back my phone.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.000
Let me take care of the drug test matter.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.520
No, you stay out of it. This is my family’s matter.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.720
I can take care of it.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.320
Aren’t I one of your family too?

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.880
Am I not the one you love?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.400
Phaya, about Doc and I, you know I only think of him as my brother.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.160
So, please stop being jealous. Can’t you guys just be friends?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.560
As long as Chalothorn is still in your life,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.360
I’ll never stop getting in the way

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.600
It’s all right if you don’t trust him. But can’t you just trust me?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.800
Why are you like this?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.200
What has he done to you? Why do you hate him so much?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640
Because he’s the Naga!

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.960
the one who kept us apart in our past lives.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.360
He’s the one who tried to kill me and take you away from me.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.080
That drowning that almost killed me, it was because of him.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.960
He was trying to kill me.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.640
I never thought you’d be like this. Just because you don’t want me to get close to him,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.600
you even came up with this nonsense.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.520
Hey, I didn’t make it up. I’m telling you the truth.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.120
If you don’t believe me, let’s go ask the Abbot. He knows everything

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.560
That’s enough. I’m going to let it slide and ignore what you just said.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.480
But don’t ever mention it to me again.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.040
I have an important job to do.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.360
Kai’s body must be in this forest. I have to find it.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.200
(Thunder sound)

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.240
(Thunder and lightening)

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.680
(Thunder and lightening)

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.920
(Sighs)

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.000
(Thunder and lightening)

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Your time is coming, isn’t it?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.840
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him for you.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.200
Don’t you worry.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.840
(Door knocking)

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.960
Tharn, come out and eat something, dear.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.360
Don’t lock yourself in there.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.360
(Door knocking)

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.560
Tharn.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.640
(Door knocking)

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.120
Tharn

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.200
(Door opening.)

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.120
Who are you? Why are you in my grandson’s room?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.240
When the time comes, you and I will finally be together.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.240
Grandma.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.360
I miss you so much.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.520
Aww, don’t sweet talk me.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.600
Where’s that friend of yours that you want to introduce to me?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.000
He’s outside. Let me introduce him to you.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.680
Doc.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.600
Here he is, Grandma. The one I want to introduce to you.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.320
Phaya, please protect Tharn

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.920
Grandmas,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.920
please eat something.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.520
Both of you haven’t eaten anything since last night.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.960
I’m afraid you two might faint.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.840
I hardly slept last night too.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.800
I heard a loud and scary noise from the forest

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.280
Or maybe, it really came from the Tiger-man.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.760
I'm not hungry.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.760
Your brother has disappeared into the woods with Tharn since last night.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.640
And he’s not answering my call.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.920
Please let both of them come back safely.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.120
The cops already told them they would take care of it but they never listened.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.760
I’m afraid we won’t be having a vacation this time.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.800
Oh! Grandmas!

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.520
They are back.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.240
Huh?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.120
Phaya! Tharn!

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.600
Are you all right? We have been worried sick about you.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.280
You just disappeared and didn’t answer my call too.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.200
We went looking for some evidence about Joe’s case.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.880
But we found nothing.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.960
Sorry for keeping you waiting and worrying about us.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.000
Joe still refuses to say anything.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.200
He keeps insisting that Kai was killed by the Tiger-man.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.400
But according to the drug test, we found drugs in his body.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.920
Grandma, can I go seach Joe’s shelter?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.800
Since it’s happening with our workers,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.640
I’m worried about you.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.800
Let’s go and talk inside, shall we?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.280
Tharn.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.120
Can I have a word with you?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.800
You don’t look good, are you okay?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.599
I have a bad feeling.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.200
Like that time when I lost your parents.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.839
Looks like that bad feeling is coming back.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.640
What the Abbot used to tell me...

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.000
when you were very young,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.720
I don’t want it to happen to you again.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.040
I can only pray...

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.920
what the Abbot said

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.000
about that someone...

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.360
who’d be able to protect you

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.280
would be Phaya.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.960
I know you’re worried about me.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.520
But everything that’s happening here,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.040
might lead me to find the person who killed my parents.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.680
I’m a police officer after all.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.920
I have my father’s blood in me.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.280
I can feel that eveything is going to end soon.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.920
The person who killed dad,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.920
the one who created all these terrible things,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.400
and also drugs network with Montree being the man behind it all,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.520
all of these must be connected in some way.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.080
I’m going to find a solid evidence to take them down.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.200
I promise I’ll be careful.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.280
I’ll infrom my unit as soon as I can,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.160
and will ask them to send me a backup team.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.840
I promise....

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.560
not to do anything on impluse and make you worried.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.680
I know I can’t stop you.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.840
So, please always stay focus.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.080
If what the Abbot said is true,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.000
that person is coming to take you back.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.960
Yes,sir. I’ll send you some artworks as a gift then.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.120
(Laughing)

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.480
Yes. Thank you, sir.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.040
Hey.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.640
Send someone to deliver the gift to our dear sir tomorrow.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.600
Don’t forget to take a picture too.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.800
Just in case they might betray us. I’m not going to let them get away so easily.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.120
Yes, sir.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.040
Have you sent someone to that side to load in the drugs?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.240
- Working on it, sir.
- Okay.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.080
Hey, you. The one holding the gun.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.000
You go with Khom so that you can learn from him.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.800
Yes, sir.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.080
Good.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.480
After this shipping lot, I might have to take a break for a while.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.920
Inspector Akk is keeping an eye on me.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.320
I have to get rid of him.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.560
I want someone who knows the route that Joe and Kai took

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.360
when they went into the woods that day.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.440
I’ll pay you 10,000 baht.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.640
Does anyone want to volunteer?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.040
Or just tell me how much you want.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.720
I don’t think anyone would want to take you into the woods.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.040
They are all afraid of the Tiger-man.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.520
Don’t worry, a Tiger-man is not real.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.000
Joe was having a hallucination because he used drugs.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.440
The test result has confirmed that Joe had drugs in his body.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.400
Fine then, if that’s what you want to believe.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.360
But we believe he was killed and eaten by the Tiger-man.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.240
Right?

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.640
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.240
Let me warn you.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.680
If you go into that woods and get attacked by the Tiger-man, we’re not going to help you.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.760
Does anyone still want to go with them?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.160
No.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.280
Whatever. We’re off to work now.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.880
Hurry up.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.800
Joe is still detained. The police said he’s still having some hallucinations.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.520
He can barely answer the questions.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.640
I don’t think he’d be able to tell us about the route into the woods.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.360
I think Kham probably has planned it all.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.760
If Kai’s body is really in the woods,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.440
I’m afraid it might already be destroyed

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.560
by tigers or other carnivorous animals.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.960
(Gunshot)
Hey.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.200
Hey.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.000
What’s wrong?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.160
I saw Kham going to get killed.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.640
Tharn, wait!

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.960
Tharn!

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.880
Wait up!

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.840
- Has anyone seen Kham?
- No, sir.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.560
Has anyone seen Kham?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.040
Or did he go back into the woods to destroy the evidence?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.920
Hey.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.560
I think we’ve found him.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.440
Tharn.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.480
This is probably the route that Kham often uses.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.120
He left a mark here.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.720
Let’s go.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.280
(Exciting sound)

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:42.080
(Thrilling music)

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.720
How is it going?

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.080
Tharn doesn’t pick up my call.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.960
He doesn’t read his LINE either.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.040
Have you tried calling Phaya?

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.720
Yeah, I called both of them.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.720
Wonder what they are doing.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.720
Or are they busy cuddling each other in bed?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.800
Yai, does Inspector know you’re calling Tharn?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.360
Don’t worry. I have a plan.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.200
Let’s pretend we’re bumping into them here.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.960
Inspector is coming.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.120
Get ready. The forest rangers have arrived.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.480
How is it going, sir?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.240
Does the disciplinary committeee agree that Tharn can get back to work?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.400
Yes, sir.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.280
If you want me to narrow it down, I think this area is probably where they are producing drugs.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.320
It’s deep in the forest with lots of wild animals. Most local people don’t go there.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.120
Inspector, that area is close to the sawmill that belongs to Tharn’s grandmother.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.440
I think we should call Tharn.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.480
(Digging)

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.960
(Pouring out petrol)

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.600
(Twig snapping)

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.160
Hey!

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.840
(Gunshot)

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.800
(Gunshot)

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.000
Stop it, Kham!

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.680
Drop your weapon and turn yourself in!

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.440
(Lighting a match)

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.400
Stop!, Kham!

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.760
(Gunshot)

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.400
Hey!

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:26.960
Stop!

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.440
Kham, stop!

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.520
Hey!

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.760
Stop!

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.400
(Thrilling music)

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.480
Kham, stop!

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.200
(Gunshot)

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.160
(Gunshot)

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.520
Hey!

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.040
That's the guy who stole our medicine last week.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.240
(Thrilling music)

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.440
Chart, go take care of that drug thief.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.120
I’m going to handle those two cops.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.040
Let’s go!

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.880
Turn yourself in!

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.160
No! I didn’t do anything wrong!

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.680
We know everything. That body in the hole is Kai, isn’t it?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.080
And what you just dig out are drugs, aren’t they?

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.840
Where did he get all those drugs?

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.200
(Gunshot)
Careful!

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.160
(Gunshot)
Tharn.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.040
Phaya!

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.800
Hey

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.840
(Sound of branch breaking)

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.640
(A branch dropping on the ground)

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.600
(Gunshot)
Hey

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.320
Put down your weapon

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.640
(Gunshot)
Hey

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.040
All of you, spread out!

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.200
Time’s running out. Please lead the way.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.680
(Gunshot)

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.720
(Gunshot)

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.240
(Fighting)

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.480
(Gunshot)
Hey

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.440
(Fighting)

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.680
(Fighting)

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.400
(Fighting)

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.200
(Gunshot)

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.920
(Fighting)

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.120
(Gunshot)

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.480
Phaya, watch out!

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.680
(Gunshot)

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.720
(Gunshot)

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.920
(Gunshot)

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.280
(Gunshot)

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.680
(Fighting)

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.680
(Gunshot)

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.440
(Fighting)

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.600
(Fighting)

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.480
(Fighting)

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.520
(Fighting)

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.920
Tharn!

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.080
Watch out!

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.120
(Gunshot)

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.240
(Gunshot)

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.840
(Exciting sound)

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.120
- Hey / - Hey

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.640
(Gunshot)

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.840
(Gunshot)

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.720
(Gunshot)

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.280
- Hey / - Hey

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.040
Careful!

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.160
(Gunshot)

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.240
Oh, shoot!

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.280
watch out

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.840
(Exciting sound)

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800
I’ll send you to your parents.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.800
(Fighting)

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.520
Isn’t that bastard going to give me a break?!

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.680
Everything should be okay by tomorrow, sir.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.800
Clear out this lot as soon as you can. Don’t mess it up.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.120
Yes, sir.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.240
Hey!

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.840
Did you get him?

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.760
He got away.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.800
What about you? Did you get rid of those cops?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.240
Don’t let go of my hand! Hang on!

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.800
What are you doing?! Let me go!

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880
No!

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.320
I’m not going to leave you here!

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.120
Let me go! You can’t hold it any longer.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.480
You said you wouldn’t leave me.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.640
You promised!

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.560
Are you going to leave me?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.720
What are you doing?!

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.560
No. No.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.080
I’m sorry...

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.280
What are you doing?!

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.840
...that I couldn’t keep my promise.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.200
Don’t do that!

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:33.960
No. No.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.840
No!

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.000
Phaya!

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.440
Phaya!

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.160
(Exciting sound)

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.159
So, it’s true.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.760
I guess I don’t have explain anything now.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.480
Phaya already told you everything.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.800
So...

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.719
all this time,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.239
those that I love have been taken away from me all because of you?

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.440
I’m sorry.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.840
But I can’t lose you.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.080
You belong to me.

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:52.520
You are mine and only mine.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:55.920
Come with me.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.080
You can’t help Phaya anymore. It’s over.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.000
What do you mean?

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.800
Haven’t I warned you before?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.920
That if you choose him over me,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.240
you will lose him in the end.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.280
You can’t love anyone.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.400
I’m the only one who can stay by your side.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.760
And I will never make you cry or face with any loss again.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.680
- I have to go save Phaya.
- Stop it, Tharn.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.680
Phaya is dead.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.680
Even if you can save him now, he’ll evetually die.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.440
You can never be with him.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.800
I’m the only one who can be by your side.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.120
You are mine.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.880
Only mine.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.200
I’ll never make you cry or lose anyone.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.960
You have to promise me that you’d come with me.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.480
I’m not going anywhere with you.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.600
Please don’t push me. I don’t want to make the matter worse.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.280
If you choose to stay with Phaya,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.080
he won’t be the only one that I’ll kill.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.680
I might kill everyone that you love.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.760
It’s time for you to choose.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.040
It’s not just about Phaya, the man that you love.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.840
It’s about everyone that you love.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.480
(Incoming call)

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.160
Where are you?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.720
We’re going to make an arrest.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.320
Maybe you should go after Phaya and Tharn first.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.040
They got attacked.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.040
What?

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.120
Tharn and Phaya got attacked?

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.200
Where are they now?

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.280
They’re at...

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.160
Whom are you talking to?

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.440
Chart?

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.600
Chart?

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.520
Chart?

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.560
Phaya

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.400
Tharn.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.400
You’re safe now.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.960
Don’t say anything.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.720
They will come and rescue us tomorrow.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.960
Who are they?

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.640
No one knows we’re here.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.560
It’s all right.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.520
Let’s stay here tonight.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.080
We’ll look for a way out tomorrow.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.600
Let’s get some sleep.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320
Those trainings we did

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.320
have finally paid off.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.920
The only way for us to survive...

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.120
is that I must get out of here and call for help.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.720
Let’s go together.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.040
What if Khom and his men are waiting up there.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.200
You can’t fight them.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.120
Let’s go together.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.200
Ouch.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.720
Ouch.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.760
Does it hurt a lot?

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.920
Neh, I’m all right.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.320
I’m so sorry.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.080
Since I’ve come into your life,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.560
you often got hurt and almost got killed too.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.960
Even if I weren’t dating you, I’m still a cop.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.160
It’s my job to live with danger.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.800
I’m glad you’ve come into my life.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.520
You’ve fulfilled my life.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.040
I promise...

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.120
that I’ll never forget you.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.680
That you are the one I love.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.600
And I will always love you.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400
Tharn,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.760
Are you all right?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.400
What made you say something like that?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:01.400
(Romantic sound)

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.120
idolfactory

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.680
Yai, please find Phaya and Tharn.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.160
Yeah.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.360
I hope they are safe.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.200
I pray to the holy spirits, please make everyone come back safely.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.080
Careful, Tharn.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.880
(Gunshot)

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.800
(Gunshot)

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.160
You son of a bitch just can’t leave me alone, can you?!

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.160
(Gunshot)

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.040
Dammit!

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.360
(Gunshot)

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:05.800
Tharn!

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.560
Khem!

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.120
Khem!

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.000
What happened to Khom and Montree?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.480
Phaya, thank you so much for staying by my side.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.240
Are you here to take Tharn away from me?

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.800
Tharn!

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.640
🎵I still keep this love within me.🎵

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.280
🎵No matter how long it has been, I still want to see you.🎵

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.080
🎵Even though it’s as long as eternity,🎵

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:56.480
🎵I want you to know you’re the only one that I want.🎵

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:06.760
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:14.360
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.840
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.920
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:29.440

🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
