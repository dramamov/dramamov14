WEBVTT

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760
Based on our separate interrogations,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.800
Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi's testimonies

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200
were most likely coordinated beforehand.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.519
This guy

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.290
is taking all the blame.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.360
If he doesn't admit

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.420
that he was instigated by Lu Ningzhi,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640
it will be

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.560
difficult for us to find evidence

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.240
to convict Lu Ningzhi.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.960
Also,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360
Lu Ningzhi wasn't

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.560
physically present at the crime scene.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.760
And Zhu Chongliang

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.600
can't provide any testimony that would implicate Lu Ningzhi

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.560
as the mastermind behind this.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.250
The summons period is almost over.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.480
We have to let her go.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.800
Lu Ningzhi probably knew five years ago

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.280
how to distance herself

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.840
and escape legal responsibility.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.120
That's why Chi Xiao,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
or the Fox, chose her.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.120
With the Fox's help

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.759
and Tao Han and Zhu Chongliang

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.620
willingly becoming her weapons,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000
she could perfectly avoid responsibility again.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.960
Has the Fox's identity

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.880
been verified?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200
There are many people named Chi Xiao in the system.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600
We need more specific filtering criteria.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.440
This Fox, just like Old K,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.080
might just be a code name.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.020
Although we don't know

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.200
why these people orchestrated

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.600
so many vigilante cases,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm certain that

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.440
these five cases

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250
all have specific targets.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.440
12,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.160
14,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.960
25.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.960
These three numbers

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.520
appear in all five cases.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.740
But we can't find any pattern yet.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.600
I can't tell if they're

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.560
deliberately provoking us

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520
or trying to hint at something.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.160
Where's the number 14 this time?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.160
Indeed.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.079
We really need to figure out

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.000
what these numbers actually represent.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.880
We can't let up.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.520
Otherwise when similar cases appear in the future,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.920
we'll be clueless again.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.200
We can't allow Dongzhou

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.060
to remain in such a state of panic.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200
That's right.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.440
So,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.820
wherever the evidence leads,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.360
that's where we stop.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.200
We need to maintain this spirit of thorough investigation,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.040
but

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040
we shouldn't get stuck in a dead end.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440
We need to investigate the numbers,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.840
but we must also follow proper procedures.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Let's transfer the case to the prosecutor's office as soon as possible.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.600
Okay.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.520
Yes, yes.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.280
Who are you?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.450
What do you want?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720
Inciting murder.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.080
You don't really think

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.010
you can live out the rest of your life in peace, do you?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.800
You're Fox's person.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.160
This isn't what we agreed on.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.200
Let me go now.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.480
Fox.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.130
She's not worthy of commanding me.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.160
Besides,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.159
she can barely save herself now.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.920
Whatever she promised you

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200
simply can't be fulfilled anymore.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.400
Who really sent you here?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.120
I'll give you money.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.159
Just let me go.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.960
Help!

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.920
Help! Is anyone there?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.080
Don't scream.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.120
Lu Ningzhi manipulates people

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.850
and treats lives as worthless.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.160
She has repeatedly escaped legal punishment.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.400
You police can't punish her,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.200
the law can't punish her.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.520
So I'll deliver justice myself.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.520
I'm at Factory 14,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.840
waiting for you all to witness.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.920
Fourteen.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480
It's buried here.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.500
Sure enough, all three appeared.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.960
Is this person a relative of those victims?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.170
Definitely not.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.600
There's no anger in his emotions.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
He's clearly targeting the police.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.920
No matter what,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.000
safety is our top priority.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.680
If they dare to challenge the police so blatantly,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.120
they must be well-prepared.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.000
Stay alert,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.860
ensure safety,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.120
select the team and move out.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.760
Got it.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.920
What's happening?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.760
The group's people

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.760
have taken Lu Ningzhi to Factory 14,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.360
and the Major Crimes Unit is heading there now.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.600
Sir,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.240
the source of this information is unclear.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.840
Going there rashly

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.880
could be dangerous.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.560
I don't know why Old K

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.440
is so determined

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.920
to restore Chi Xia's memory.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.480
He might want to get something from her.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.520
But for Chi Xia,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.680
this is definitely trouble.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.810
Since it's trouble,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.600
I won't shield her from it.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.060
Who will protect her then?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.080
Don't move!

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.880
Police!

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.200
Put the knife down.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
Drop your weapon.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.320
I'm sorry.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.280
My goal is to kill her.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520
You won't do that.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.240
From the video you sent

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.400
to the police, it's clear

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.000
that you understand the law.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.680
Kidnapping

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.640
or murder,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.240
you know the difference very well.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.840
You won't make a choice that works against you.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.159
Step back!

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.400
You can try.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.840
Put down the gun.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.200
Put down the gun.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.680
Now we're even.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.960
We can talk now.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.320
Be careful. We can talk now.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.180
We can talk now.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.730
But you're not the person in the video.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.760
He usually holds the knife with his right hand.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.800
But you use your left hand.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.000
Without his orders,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.680
you wouldn't dare to kill.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.480
Tell me.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.930
What do you want?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.240
Someone who incites others to kill

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.840
and escapes legal punishment.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.240
I kill whenever I want to.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.800
I don't need anyone's orders.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.760
This is called carrying out justice.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.490
If you're really so righteous.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.410
Let that female officer Chi Xia come instead.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.680
Would she be willing?

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.680
I am willing.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.960
Chi Xia!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.040
Save the hostages first.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.170
We'll play it by ear.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.020
One for one, right?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.160
I go over there.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.140
She comes here.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.080
Agreed.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.080
Don't move!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.039
Put the knife down.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.679
Freeze!

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.400
Step back.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.130
I've been your target from the beginning, haven't I?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400
As expected from you,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.160
Officer Chi.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.660
What's the purpose of doing this?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.880
Light it up.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.840
Save me.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.720
Help me.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.080
Little fox.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.800
You must survive.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.040
Over here.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.930
Keep searching.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.920
Chi Xia.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.540
Let me tell you something.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.660
I'm afraid I can't get out of here.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.850
I'll draw them away.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.680
Run down this path.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.560
Don't look back.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.680
Search carefully.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.040
I'm over here.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.340
Go. Over there.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560
Don't look back.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.600
Keep going.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.200
Chi Xia

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.080
Chi Xia

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.720
I'll go help Qu Bai.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.400
Stay here.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.120
Don't move.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.290
Keep yourself safe.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.800
Don't look back.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.920
Keep moving forward.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.480
Hurry up.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.820
This way. This way.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.480
Hurry up.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.400
Keep going down this path

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.620
and you'll be safe.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.160
Go now.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.240
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240
What about uncle?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.000
Only if you survive

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.320
will you have a chance to save him.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.180
I can only accompany you this far.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.240
Go!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.720
Keep walking forward.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.650
Don't look back.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.840
Little fox,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.640
you must survive.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.680
You're awake.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.410
How are you feeling?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.440
Let me tell you,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.280
your arm

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.480
was just reset after dislocation.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.400
Move it around

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.480
and see if anything feels uncomfortable.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.280
I'm fine.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.610
What about the kidnappers?

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.240
They said

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.730
they were just hired to do a job.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160
I'm pretty sure

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.800
it's related to that fox.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.960
Qu Bai,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.280
is he okay?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.800
He's fine. His injuries aren't serious.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.930
Just took a few hits.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.480
Qu Bai.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.760
How did he know about our operation?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.640
Long time no see.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.090
Long time no see.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.600
I mean...

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.080
It's been a really long time.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.680
It's been a really long time.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.610
Why do you like persimmons and pomegranates?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640
I have a sister.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.280
Whenever she won a fight,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.410
she would get some persimmons.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.210
But she never ate them herself.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.240
She always saved them for me.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.360
She didn't know

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.580
those were the most delicious things I've ever tasted.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.890
What a coincidence.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.730
I used to get into fights when I was little.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.330
Whenever I got hurt,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.280
my brother would give me a lychee candy.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.440
He told me,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240
'Have some candy,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.530
and the wound won't hurt anymore.'

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.450
Are you feeling better?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.580
Just a scratch.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.120
I'm used to it.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.490
This is the highest mountain in Dongzhou.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.880
I still remember

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.680
how you used to take me to the highest mountain over there.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680
Looking down at all of Lawa Village.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.240
We had so little free time.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.160
That's why those moments were especially precious.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.720
But I hated that place.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.200
That's why I had to leave.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.609
You have the right to choose your freedom.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.599
I left.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.119
You helped me.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.000
Lawa Village isn't big,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.240
but it always gives people

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.440
a feeling that you can never escape.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.080
I must help you.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.570
The law casts a wide net.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.720
Do you think Old K can escape?

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.360
Qubai.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.440
Walk toward the light.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.020
Don't put me in a difficult position.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.520
That light

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.360
has already shone into my heart.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.960
It hasn't faded all these years.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.100
No matter the past,

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.520
present,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.400
or future.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.210
Before Fu Gang died,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.440
he put the paper formula in a coded box

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.160
and hid it somewhere.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.880
I remembered a sequence of numbers,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.520
including but not limited to these digits.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.640
I'm guessing

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.040
there must be a master key

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.880
that can decode this sequence.
