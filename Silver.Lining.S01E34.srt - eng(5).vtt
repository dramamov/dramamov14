00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.980
Director Chang

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.400
Please look at these two blackboards.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.640
This row of numbers at the top

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920
was left by Comrade Zhang Jinguo

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.600
in the opera text.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.880
It shows the mapping rules

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.680
between numbers and letters

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.080
which is part of the encryption code.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960
And this row below

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.360
is the array that appeared

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.920
in Chi Xia's memory.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.680
Based on our analysis,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.280
we can draw a conclusion.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.920
Comrade Zhang Jinguo and Comrade Fu Gang

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.480
used 26 numbers

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.960
to correspond with 26

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.880
scrambled letters.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.120
In other words,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.120
if we can find

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.250
the exact correlation between the numbers and letters,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120
we can decode the message

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.060
that Comrade Fu Gang left behind.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.240
This is easy to understand.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.320
They hid the encryption rules

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.320
in the opera script.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.440
But for the remaining 23 numbers,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.840
how did you figure out

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.320
which letters they correspond to?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.039
Director Chang,

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.770
look at this.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.800
The entire script is clean.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.600
However,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.200
only these three letters

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.080
are separately marked.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.160
Because these three letters

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.600
cannot exist as

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
initial pinyin letters in Chinese.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.360
And in the entire text,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.520
there are only Chinese characters,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.680
no letters at all.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.040
So conversely,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160
this precisely indicates

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.199
that from 1 to 23,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.000
these 23 numbers

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.200
each correspond to specific letters.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.520
23 Chinese characters with different initials YNO

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.250
23 Chinese characters with different initials.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.040
Using numbers to derive Chinese characters

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400
can be done in countless ways.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.200
However,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.600
if we only use

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.840
single digits up to 23,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.060
to correspond with characters of different initials,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.320
then there are limited possibilities.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.120
From a logical perspective,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.680
if it's a completely random encryption rule,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
then both of them

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.040
would need to memorize

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
all 23 numbers.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.360
This would be very risky.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.720
So I believe

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.880
that within this opera text,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.720
there must be a simple

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.640
and efficient encryption rule,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.640
allowing both people to quickly

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.760
and accurately

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.320
encrypt and decrypt information.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.400
Therefore, in conclusion,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.560
I've listed all the lyrics in order,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840
writing down their initials

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.600
and first letters as well.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920
But pay attention here.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920
Kill the traitor.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.480
For characters that are repeated,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.800
we'll hide them.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.840
For example, 'zan' is Z.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.040
This is also Z.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.760
So we don't need it.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.560
'Na' is N.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.120
[Jiao Zan (Moth brand, body

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.280
This is also N.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.940
So we don't need it either.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.280
From 1 to 23.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.560
We will write out these 23 numbers

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.760
using the letters

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.930
that have appeared.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.400
This is 6.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.480
This is 7.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.200
We'll write out

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.880
all these numbers in sequence.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.280
We can draw a conclusion.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.540
[Zhuxianxian Moth Brand]

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960
Comrade Zhang Jinguo emphasized this.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.440
It's 1.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.960
Plus one piece.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.160

14 appeared here before.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.320
Let's write it again.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200
So finally,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.000
we've reached an

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.700
accurate conclusion.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.089
Director Chang,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.260
please give us instructions.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.080
Luo Xun.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.320
I didn't expect you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.440
to be so good at cracking patterns.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.450
Verify it immediately.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.560
If we follow this lead

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.880
and find evidence,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.800
then we

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.080
will truly gain the upper hand.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.200
Okay.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.680
It matches.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.480
Captain Luo,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.040
take a look at this.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.840
Jue.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.880
Considering Fu Gang's

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.360
limited freedom of movement,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720
his hiding place shouldn't be far from

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.920
Lawa Village.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.680
So we can only search

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.920
in Mengkunbang near Lawa Village,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.640
Dongzhou City bordering Mengkunbang,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.560
and Yuhe City.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
The possible location

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.000
these eight letters.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.400
Divided by initials and finals,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.000
they represent at most four Chinese characters.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.800
I tried searching for four-character locations

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.280
but found none that matched.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.560
Then I tried three characters,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.480
still nothing.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.560
Finally, I tried two characters

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.160
and found 16 possibilities.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.200
But

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.640
locations that have existed for over 15 years.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.320
Look,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.720
first page, fourth line,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.440
Jile.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.680
There's a cemetery in our Dongzhou City

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.940
called Jile Cemetery.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720
As for this LIZE,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.800
I think it could be someone's name,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.130
likely with surname Li.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.560
And this ZE at the end,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.280
which tone it is exactly,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.920
we need to go to the cemetery to investigate.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.520
The item might be hidden in this person's grave,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.360
or even in their urn.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.960
How's it going, Cui?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.800
It's not possible.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.060
We can't force it open.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.920
It has a self-destruct program inside.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.400
If we try to force it open,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.320
it will destroy all the criminal evidence inside.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.720
I believe the original intention of its design

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.120
was that even if a suspect

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.480
gets hold of this urn,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.800
without the password,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800
forcing it open

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.730
would still destroy all the formulas inside.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.159
But the problem is,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.120
according to Chi Xia's feedback,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.840
Old K is extremely confident that

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.600
as long as he can find the location,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.040
he can get what's inside.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.650
He must already know the password.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.120
Can you make a device?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.159
What kind of device?

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.920
One that looks exactly like

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.360
this urn,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.520
a perfect one-to-one replica.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.280
But whenever someone enters the password,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.540
we can simultaneously obtain that password information.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.920
It should be possible.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.600
However,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.800
I'll need some time.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.720
Good.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.360
Thanks for your hard work,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.620
but we need it quickly.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.080
Curly.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.960
You can contact Chi Xia now.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.040
Tell her

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.880
we've already applied technical processing to the urn

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.440
and will set up surveillance here.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.200
She can now use the data array to exchange for Fu Gang.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.000
Yes.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.200
Make sure Fu Gang returns to the country safely.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.120
Tell her

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.740
to be careful herself too.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.360
Okay.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.480
Captain Luo,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.200
it's me.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.640
Old K is coming back tomorrow.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.160
The operation time is 6 PM.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.040
He's using a fake address

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.700
to test if I've really turned.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.000
So send your people to the Lizang Museum

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.040
to put on a show for him.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.200
Make him believe that Jile Cemetery

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.760
hasn't been discovered by the police

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.000
and think it's still safe.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.720
No.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.880
You'll definitely be exposed this way.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.520
Have you considered your own situation?

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.720
Luo Xun, listen to me.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.840
I won't be with Old K tomorrow.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.539
He gave me another assignment

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.080
also at 6 PM.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.400
He wants me to follow people from the Kete Group

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.260
to the Lilong Hotel at the border.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.050
Negotiating with a pharmacist

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.720
who can't deliver the goods by the 8th of next month.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.160
He's also in a dead-end situation.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.080
He wouldn't dare offend the Special Division at this point.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.040
So when we arrest him

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.500
at the Paradise Cemetery,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.960
you won't need to worry

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.360
about my presence there.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.120
Just set up the operation with confidence.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.180
I know what you're worried about.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040
At the hotel,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.200
Old K has no way to control the people from the Kote Group.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.530
So don't worry about me.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.480
Chi Xia.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.680
Tomorrow you'll be facing

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.520
a group of desperate criminals with nothing to lose.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.320
Rest assured,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.240
I'll definitely set up an operation at the Lilong Hotel to support you.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.320
Don't try to be a hero.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.520
You must stay safe.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.280
If we lose the Kote people,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.520
I can catch them again.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.240
But tomorrow I need you to come home safely.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.120
Do you hear me?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.400
I understand.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.320
This operation

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.360
is highly prioritized by the provincial department.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.490
The criminal organization led by Old K

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.800
has been entrenched in Dongzhou for years.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.060
Their power is immense

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.640
and their reach is extensive,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.040
neither can be underestimated.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.000
Now they've even entered the drug market,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.440
posing a severe threat

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.480
to people's lives and property.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.280
Therefore,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.120
this operation must succeed in one strike,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.200
and we cannot let him retreat back to Lawa Village.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.880
Understood.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.100
Please rest assured, Director Qiao.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.120
Good.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.800
Now for the assignments.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.560
Cui,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.840
lead the security team

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.300
to set up surveillance at the Lizang Museum.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.760
Don't be too discreet.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.640
Make sure you're noticed.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.370
Understood.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.600
Lin Wenjue,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.680
take your team to the Lilong Hotel

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.600
to support Chi Xia.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.480
Take more people with you.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.210
Understood.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.560
Luo Xun,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.850
the arrest at Jile Cemetery

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.560
will be entirely your responsibility.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.720
I'll make sure the mission is accomplished.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.520
Comrades,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.720
The foreign criminal organization from Lawa Village

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.640
has already infiltrated Dongzhou.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.680
The organization's leader, Huang Weisheng,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.240
will stop at nothing

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.800
to achieve his goals.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.360
In the past six months,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.960
several serial killings

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.400
have terrified the people of Dongzhou.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.480
And now,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.920
Huang Weisheng has set foot on Dongzhou soil.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.160
In this operation,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.720
we must catch him red-handed.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.040
It's time to free our people

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.200
from their fear.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.440
We must let them

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.240
live in a land protected by law.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.760
Our country

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.000
will not tolerate

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.560
infiltration by foreign criminal organizations.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.490
For our country,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.640
for our people,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.180
and for the honor of the police force,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.680
we must eliminate this cancer

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.690
and root it out completely.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.160
Understood?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.040
Understood.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.200
Luo Xun.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.840
Yes, sir.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.320
For this operation,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.680
you'll be in full command.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.440
Yes, sir.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.000
Let's go.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.760
Yes.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.680
Captain Luo,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.120
it's been 15 minutes past the agreed time.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.200
There's no sign of Chi Xia,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.330
and no pharmacist has shown up either.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.490
I made a mistake.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.760
The Lilong Hotel was just a front.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.840
Chi Xia must be with Old K now.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.000
Jue,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.400
get everyone out of there now.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.720
Understood.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.400
Got it.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.840
Everyone,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.640
fall back now!

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.280
Mobile unit,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.480
stand by.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.520
Copy that.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.040
Qu Bai's car.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.440
Chi Xia

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.000
All units,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.970
await my orders.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.080
Be ready to surround and arrest the target.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.760
Team One, copy.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.620
Team Two, copy.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.320
Mountain road interception team in position.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.160
Block all roads

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.640
and stop all passing vehicles.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.240
Copy that.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.040
The urn is here.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.060
Secure the password lock.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.800
Got it.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.080
Done.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.840
Collect evidence.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.480
Got it.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.760
Captain Luo.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.440
Okay.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.040
Everyone,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.240
move in and surround.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.210
Team two, take the left.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.460
Assault team, move in.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.720
Rear team is in position.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.040
Team one, leapfrog forward.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.860
Don't move.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.720
Freeze!

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.200
Police!

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.800
Don't move!

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.520
Police!

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.420
Freeze!

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.160
Drop your weapons.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240
Put all guns down.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.040
Nobody move.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.400
This is a pressure-triggered bomb.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.840
If it drops to the ground even slightly,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.680
the bomb on Chi Xia

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.000
will detonate immediately.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.400
The bomb isn't powerful,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.930
but it's enough to kill her.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.800
Remove the blockade.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.200
Or Chi Xia

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.840
dies with us.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.960
Captain Luo,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.280
don't worry about me.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.020
Arrest them first.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.800
Everyone,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.520
fall back.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.760
Find a clear shot.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.880
Copy that.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.480
Back off!

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.160
Step back!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.440
There's a dragnet outside.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.960
Even if you fight like a cornered beast,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.760
you can't escape justice.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.320
In my life,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.420
I've seen too many smart-aleck kids.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.080
When the tide washes away the sand,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.520
only I remain standing.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.600
Chi Xia,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.440
do you dare to die with me?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800
I understand now.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.200
Old K is holding Chi Xia hostage

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.560
so he can escape

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.720
while forcing us to hand over the formula.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.780
There's no time to find a bomb expert.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.800
Everyone,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.810
stay in position

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.180
and be ready to surround and capture him.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.119
Captain Luo.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.250
It's not your fault.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.520
Captain Luo.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.040
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.680
Let's begin.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.599
Tell me the chemical formula

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.690
in exchange for Chi Xia's life.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.490
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.320
If you try to defuse the bomb,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.410
you'll be collecting a corpse.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.640
Chi Xia.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.800
This is the chemical formula.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
Memorize it quickly.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.000
I trust your memory.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.820
I've memorized it.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.440
K.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.060
Listen carefully.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.800
Chi Xia is the only one who knows this formula now.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.200
If she dies today,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.640
even if you escape the police,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.450
on the 8th of next month,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.520
you'll die even more miserably.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.320
You're asking for death.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.120
I'll count to ten.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.480
If you don't hand over the formula within ten seconds,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.140
both of you will die together.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.520
Luo Xun,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520
stay away from me.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.960
Go away.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.560
Nine.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.240
Seven.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.720
You're such an idiot.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.720
Five.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.360
It's already dark now.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.680
Old K is hiding in the dense forest.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.800
If something goes wrong,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.520
we'll be letting the tiger back to the mountain.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.760
He must have a backup plan.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.220
I might as well be the bait.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.660
Playing double agent.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.260
You're not clever enough.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.840
I have ten thousand ways

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200
to make you talk.
