If you meet someone who makes you feel good, follow your heart.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:24.779
I didn’t mean to yell at you.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.267
I’m sorry.

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:28.534
I’ve really started falling for you.

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:33.282
Do you really think I’d dump you for the new doctor?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.543
I’ve only known that guy for a few days.

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:37.607
You think I’d throw away a year‑long relationship for that?

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:39.709
You said you wanted a real name, right?

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:41.876
I found one with a nice meaning.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:43.858
The prince is still alive.

00:00:43.858 --> 00:00:45.632
Send someone to deal with this as soon as possible.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.551
Send our best operative.

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:52.986
Whoa.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.852
The noodles in front of the temple
are insane.

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.068
Try the red pork.

00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:56.835
It’s crazy good.

00:00:57.542 --> 00:00:58.155
Let me have some.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:00.094
Hey, Kratae!

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.212
Nooo, give me some.

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:05.144
Hey, I even ordered the special one.

00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:07.306
I like red pork too.

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.602
It’s mine. Give me some!

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:13.444
That’s enough. I can’t even eat it all.

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:15.828
It’s fine.

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:17.673
I want you to eat a lot so you’ll get bigger.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.285
Get bigger for what?

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.367
I think my body is perfect already,

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:24.434
easy to carry.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.556
I mean, if something happens to me,

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:35.326
whoever helps me can carry me easily.

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:36.722
Mhm, okay.

00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:39.793
Like Lava—he carries me all the time.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.064
He probably means when you helped him.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:47.281
And I carried him once.

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.320
I don’t carry him often.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.919
Don’t listen to him too much.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:51.019
He doesn’t make much sense.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.182
True. Lava only carried me once.

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:56.007
I don’t really like being carried.

00:01:56.307 --> 00:01:57.077
It’s achy.

00:01:57.077 --> 00:01:57.577
Huh?

00:01:58.626 --> 00:01:59.795
Don’t say anything!

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.510
Can you help me buy my roses, please?

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:07.111
Oh, Tong!

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.908
Perfect timing for some romance.

00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:11.722
How many? I’ll take them all.

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:20.083
Fine. I’ll take one then.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.286
I feel sorry for Tong.

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:26.986
Tong, make sure you focus on your studies as you grow up.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.111
Don’t end up like this dude Tum.

00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:30.570
Yes, I won’t be like this dude Tum.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.629
-Whoa, this kid!
-Good job, kid.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.504
Here, take the money.

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:41.439
Another 100, please.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.676
Clever, huh?

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:44.554
Here you go.

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:45.358
Thank you.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.002
Hey, buddy, I’ll give you one.

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.433
In case you meet someone you like,
give it to them.

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:53.225
As for me, the one I like is already here.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:15.255
Are you afraid Tum and Kratae
will find out about us?

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:17.770
I’m not afraid,

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.806
but that wasn’t the place to tell them.

00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:24.067
Also, I saw Tum flirting with Kratae.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.425
I don’t want to steal his spotlight.

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:31.915
You’re sweeter than I thought.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:35.182
You think about others more than I do.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.341
I’ve got plenty of sweet sides,

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.375
but my bad side hides them all.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.394
Oh, by the way, I’m entering a boxing match.

00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:51.736
Why would you do that?

00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:53.412
For the money.

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.450
The winner gets thirty thousand.

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:01.212
Are you short on cash?

00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:03.455
What do you need the money for?

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:13.893
I’m going to win back my dad’s motorcycle.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.418
It’s the only thing
that’ll make him proud of me.

00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:26.674
I get it,

00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.279
but I really don’t want you to get hurt.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.107
Don’t worry. You know I’m strong.

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:44.676
I’ve got the strength,

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:46.565
but I’m missing something.

00:05:49.027 --> 00:05:49.631
What’s that?

00:05:50.338 --> 00:05:51.673
Someone to cheer me on.

00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:07.954
For you.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.538
Thanks.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.725
I believe in you. You’ve got this.

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:55.518
Come on.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.893
Are you trying to make you look
even more handsome?

00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:01.842
It’s muddy.

00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:04.406
I just want people
to always see me looking good.

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:09.403
I don’t even want to think about having to share you with everyone on this island.

00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.351
Don’t worry. I can balance my time—

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:14.838
between public and private duties.

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:19.419
But since you’re are public property,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.474
I kind of get both at once.

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:28.344
Stay over at my place tonight.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.725
We haven’t slept together in a while.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:33.910
I didn’t bring any clothes.

00:07:36.608 --> 00:07:38.216
If you don’t have them,

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:46.166
then don’t wear any tonight.

00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:50.089
Wow, you’re taking advantage, huh?

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:52.851
I’d better call home

00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:54.640
and say I’m sleeping at the hospital.

00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:56.048
See?

00:07:56.883 --> 00:07:58.404
You lie to your family too.

00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:00.116
Now do you understand me?

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.689
I don’t have to lie.

00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:07.722
I can call my family and say I’m sleeping
at the future village head’s house.

00:08:07.722 --> 00:08:09.781
No, no, okay, fine!

00:08:09.974 --> 00:08:10.912
I’ll tell them myself.

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:13.313
Alright?

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:14.818
Please.

00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:22.970
Okay, okay.

00:08:26.117 --> 00:08:26.869
Let’s go.

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:40.344
Hey.

00:08:40.772 --> 00:08:41.774
What happened? My bike fell over.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:43.701
I swear I parked it fine.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.944
Help me lift it.

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:47.118
The wind isn’t even that strong.

00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:04.057
Hey, is that the guy who picked a fight
with you at your dad’s shop?

00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:06.597
Yeah, that’s him.
He’s the one who pushed me.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.081
Who the hell are you
to mess with my brother?

00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:13.295
Your brother stole that uncle’s money.

00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:14.632
That’s between his dad and him.

00:09:14.632 --> 00:09:16.178
None of your damn business!

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:17.406
Hey.

00:09:17.962 --> 00:09:20.078
Let’s just go. Don’t start anything.

00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:28.813
Hey, nice rose you got there.

00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:29.991
Let me see it.

00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:30.491
Hey!

00:09:30.983 --> 00:09:32.393
You’ve never seen a rose before?

00:09:32.393 --> 00:09:33.715
If you want one, buy your own.

00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:35.257
Hey, asshole, he just wanted to look!

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.998
Hey!

00:09:38.197 --> 00:09:39.710
Wave, run!

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:49.235
Wait.

00:09:49.492 --> 00:09:50.031
What?

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:51.912
My shoe tore.

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:54.458
Take it off.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:54.958
Huh?

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:57.125
What about you?

00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:59.034
Forget it. Hurry up.

00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:02.938
Come on!

00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:06.227
Let’s go.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.600
Where the hell did they go?

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.679
Damn troublemakers!

00:10:25.127 --> 00:10:26.598
Hey, where are you?

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.661
Come out already.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.730
Hey.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.836
Where the hell are you?

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.823
Guys, let’s get out of here.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:13.743
This is a military zone.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.980
Should we check the other side?

00:12:29.773 --> 00:12:30.956
I’ve missed this place so much.

00:12:31.727 --> 00:12:33.072
I haven’t been here in so long.

00:12:34.314 --> 00:12:35.528
The sea smells so nice.

00:12:38.654 --> 00:12:40.202
The resort owner’s right here too.

00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:42.394
Don’t you miss me?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.990
Do you remember when we first met,

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.015
when you gave me that vaccine shot?

00:12:56.086 --> 00:12:57.470
When you pretended
to be scared of needles?

00:12:58.819 --> 00:12:59.941
I was scared.

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:01.944
That’s why I flirted with you
to distract myself.

00:13:03.828 --> 00:13:06.767
I knew it, but I let it slide.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:08.367
I liked you anyway.

00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:17.156
You smell so good, young doctor.

00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:18.517
I’m not that young anymore.

00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:21.020
I’m twenty-seven now,

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:25.216
perfect age to start a family.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.468
E?

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.082
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:32.012
You want to get married already?

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:34.081
You want to get married already?

00:13:34.317 --> 00:13:36.633
I don’t know. Up to you.

00:13:44.426 --> 00:13:45.972
If you get married,

00:13:47.107 --> 00:13:48.408
what kind of wedding do you want?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.422
Something stylish by the beach,
or traditional Thai style?

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:57.702
Can we do both?

00:13:58.772 --> 00:13:59.332
Sure.

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:00.990
I’ll do whatever you want.

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:06.336
But can we start with the honeymoon suite

00:14:07.963 --> 00:14:09.108
and have the wedding later?

00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:15.663
Uncle Peng!

00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:16.530
Uncle Peng!

00:14:17.793 --> 00:14:18.598
What happened?

00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:30.626
You’re lucky. The wound isn’t too deep.

00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:33.477
You stepped on a nail,
and the wound is open like this.

00:14:34.787 --> 00:14:35.805
Be careful of infection.

00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:39.479
You’d better get a tetanus shot just in case.

00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:44.670
It’s just a small cut. No need for that.

00:14:45.527 --> 00:14:46.522
You know a lot, huh?

00:14:46.724 --> 00:14:47.807
Did you graduate from medical school?

00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:49.891
Just do what you’re told.

00:14:52.108 --> 00:14:54.727
So, tell me what the hell happened.

00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.607
Those punks at the pier
picked a fight with us.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.001
They kicked my bike

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.815
and tried to pull a gun on me.

00:15:05.478 --> 00:15:07.124
They wanted to kill you over nothing?

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.246
Did you do something to piss them off?

00:15:09.901 --> 00:15:11.098
Maybe a little.

00:15:12.232 --> 00:15:14.945
See? You’ve got a temper.

00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:16.840
Don’t you remember what happened before?

00:15:17.394 --> 00:15:18.244
I remember.

00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:20.316
Then why the hell did
you risk your life again?!

00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:22.954
Think before you act!

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.387
I’m just trouble wherever I go!

00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:27.486
Fine, I’ll leave!

00:15:30.258 --> 00:15:31.345
Hey, wait.

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:39.112
At least your nephew is okay.

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:54.727
Uncle Peng, please don’t be mad at Lava.

00:15:55.231 --> 00:15:56.994
He really didn’t mean to start anything.

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.059
I know he didn’t mean to.

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.506
But whatever he does, he should stay calm.

00:16:01.212 --> 00:16:02.955
I just don’t want history repeating itself.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.989
Did he tell you about his dad?

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:16.853
And do you know that
I don’t get along with his mom?

00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:19.102
But you’re siblings, aren’t you?

00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:21.069
Siblings can still clash.

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:23.908
When she said she was sending Lava here to straighten him out,

00:16:23.908 --> 00:16:25.803
I swore I’d help him change.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.534
I’ll take better care of him than his own mom.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.728
Even if he’s only staying a few months,
he has to go back as a better man.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.264
What did he do wrong?

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:35.918
Why do you even want to change him?

00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:37.828
From what I know,

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:39.464
he hasn’t done anything wrong.

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:43.781
Even with his dad, he only meant well.

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.703
He always protects everyone.

00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:50.603
Even tonight, he got hurt protecting me.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.518
To me, Lava doesn’t need to change at all.

00:17:01.044 --> 00:17:02.749
I just worry about his future.

00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:06.058
His dad is gone,

00:17:06.638 --> 00:17:07.736
and his mom doesn’t want him.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.858
He’s all alone, just like me.

00:17:16.149 --> 00:17:17.514
But he has you,

00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:29.612
and he has me too.

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.040
Hey, do you want to eat something?

00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:54.219
Hey.

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:10.152
Hot rice porridge.

00:19:10.328 --> 00:19:11.351
Eat first,

00:19:11.553 --> 00:19:13.474
so you can take your medicine
like Dr. Wut said.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:16.242
I don’t feel like eating.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.722
You have to.

00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:19.737
The meds will hurt your stomach otherwise.

00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:22.275
You had a high fever last night.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.429
I had to wipe you down all night.

00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:27.574
You undressed me?

00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:31.510
I told you, you had a fever.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.650
Why? Is there something I haven’t seen yet?

00:19:36.313 --> 00:19:37.172
What are you shy about?

00:19:39.944 --> 00:19:41.194
Come on, eat.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.925
Here.

00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:49.386
No, I don’t eat veggies.

00:19:51.603 --> 00:19:54.442
You get sick
and turn into a five-year-old, huh?

00:19:55.477 --> 00:19:56.662
Fine, just don’t eat.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.270
Oh, and I washed this for you.

00:20:01.152 --> 00:20:02.624
It took forever to get the bloodstains out.

00:20:02.977 --> 00:20:04.245
My hands almost peeled.

00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:18.178
Why did you wash it?

00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:20.439
You could have just thrown it away.

00:20:22.077 --> 00:20:24.866
You like it, so I wanted to clean it for you.

00:20:29.855 --> 00:20:32.735
You’ll make a mess eating, Little Lava.

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.037
You have a fever?

00:20:53.869 --> 00:20:56.001
Mm, but I’ll be fine soon.

00:20:56.309 --> 00:20:57.633
In a little while, I’ll be able to walk.

00:20:58.137 --> 00:20:59.858
Don’t worry. I’m not slacking off.

00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:01.273
Stop acting tough.

00:21:02.432 --> 00:21:04.143
Don’t forget to get that tetanus shot.

00:21:04.622 --> 00:21:06.333
Yeah, I know.
No need to keep repeating it.

00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:09.459
Wave, come run an errand with me.

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:11.142
What errand?

00:21:12.351 --> 00:21:13.939
I need to feed Lava.

00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:15.919
His foot is hurt, not his hand.

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:16.998
He can eat by himself.

00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:18.481
Let’s go.

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:23.641
You’ll be okay, right?

00:21:25.178 --> 00:21:25.854
Are you sure?

00:21:25.854 --> 00:21:26.475
Yeah.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.374
Hey, he’s not going to die.

00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:49.991
Those two, right?

00:21:50.193 --> 00:21:51.259
The ones who picked a fight with you?

00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:54.895
Yeah, them.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.786
They’ve had it out for Lava
ever since that rice noodles shop incident.

00:21:58.642 --> 00:22:00.697
These punks have been
causing trouble for too long.

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:03.444
It’s time I put an end to it.

00:22:09.063 --> 00:22:11.573
Hey, Uncle Peng!

00:22:11.573 --> 00:22:12.518
What are you doing?

00:22:12.518 --> 00:22:13.343
Calm down first!

00:22:15.561 --> 00:22:16.826
Hey, what the hell?!

00:22:16.826 --> 00:22:19.137
If you step in, I’ll gut your friend.

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:20.867
You wouldn’t dare.

00:22:20.867 --> 00:22:21.889
Why wouldn’t I?

00:22:22.645 --> 00:22:25.036
I’ll just say you two were high
and attacked me.

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:28.358
Let’s see who they’ll believe.

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:35.121
Wave, grab the knife.

00:22:35.524 --> 00:22:36.816
You think you’re tough, huh?

00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:38.535
I’ve put up with you guys for too long.

00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:45.104
You ride around bothering folks
and shaking people down.

00:22:45.558 --> 00:22:47.206
You’re ruining the island I love!

00:22:47.483 --> 00:22:48.800
You’ll never be the village head anyway.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.737
That’s my business!

00:22:52.383 --> 00:22:55.526
But if I do become one, you’re done.

00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:02.412
If you keep causing trouble,
not just with my nephew,

00:23:03.218 --> 00:23:04.717
but with anyone on this island,

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.186
you’ll have me to deal with.

00:23:09.303 --> 00:23:10.114
Got it?!

00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:21.912
Quit the drugs already.

00:23:23.273 --> 00:23:24.929
I know your parents.

00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:28.891
They work hard while you waste their money on crap like this.

00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:41.582
Uncle Peng, wait up!

00:23:43.976 --> 00:23:46.152
Uncle Peng said to bring the projector out.

00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:48.146
He’s screening a movie tonight.

00:23:49.507 --> 00:23:50.805
Where did you go with him?

00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:53.104
You don’t have to know.

00:23:54.112 --> 00:23:57.278
Just know that he really cares about you.

00:23:58.034 --> 00:24:00.281
If he cares so much,
he could talk to me nicely for once.

00:24:00.684 --> 00:24:02.920
All he ever does is yell,
like that’s supposed to motivate me.

00:24:03.222 --> 00:24:06.245
Sometimes, I just need some
straight-up encouragement.

00:24:07.807 --> 00:24:11.119
People show love in different ways.

00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:23.684
As for me, I show it like this.

00:24:29.202 --> 00:24:32.074
Excuse me, do you have a room available?

00:24:39.168 --> 00:24:41.124
I didn’t book a room.

00:24:41.527 --> 00:24:43.836
I just happened to pass by
and saw how nice this place is,

00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:45.516
so I thought I’d try my luck.

00:24:46.877 --> 00:24:48.157
We’ve got one last room.

00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:52.760
Perfect. Can I see it first?

00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:54.100
Sure, I’ll show you.

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:56.709
Where are you from?

00:24:57.818 --> 00:24:59.301
Bangkok.

00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:02.189
Bangkok? Which area?

00:25:04.608 --> 00:25:05.637
Sukhumvit.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.034
Oh, Sukhumvit is big.

00:25:08.034 --> 00:25:10.895
The beginning, middle, or end?

00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:17.477
Around the middle.

00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:18.839
Which alley?

00:25:19.771 --> 00:25:21.952
Maybe we’re neighbors.

00:25:21.952 --> 00:25:23.349
Why are you asking so many questions?

00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:24.916
You sound like a cop.

00:25:25.848 --> 00:25:27.666
Come on. I’ll show you the room.

00:25:29.178 --> 00:25:29.872
I’ll come too.

00:25:31.107 --> 00:25:34.067
No need. Your foot is still injured.

00:25:34.621 --> 00:25:36.027
If you walk too much,
your wound will get worse.

00:25:50.614 --> 00:25:52.488
This room faces the sea breeze.

00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:54.952
You won’t feel hot at all.

00:25:55.658 --> 00:25:57.643
The weather is nice this season,

00:25:58.323 --> 00:25:59.738
and the beach is beautiful.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:08.942
Is something wrong?

00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:11.426
No.

00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:14.719
I’ll take this room then.

00:26:15.853 --> 00:26:17.845
Sure. How many nights?

00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:20.427
Probably three.

00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:23.121
Alright, I’ll take care of it.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.986
You can pay when you check out.

00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:28.065
If you need anything, let me know.

00:26:28.468 --> 00:26:30.198
I’m helping out at the front desk.

00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:33.574
How long have you been working here?

00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:35.461
Not that long, actually.

00:26:36.343 --> 00:26:39.158
I’m not really staff.

00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:42.332
They saved my life,

00:26:42.735 --> 00:26:44.251
so I’m working to repay them.

00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:45.757
Saved your life?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.955
It’s a long story.

00:26:48.358 --> 00:26:49.478
You should rest.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.842
You must be tired from traveling.

00:26:51.598 --> 00:26:53.623
If you need anything, just tell me.

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.288
I’m Wave, by the way.

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:03.016
Wave?

00:27:03.772 --> 00:27:04.525
Yes.

00:27:04.853 --> 00:27:06.071
Wave—like ocean waves.

00:27:06.777 --> 00:27:08.375
Lava named me,

00:27:09.232 --> 00:27:12.160
both my nickname and my real name,

00:27:12.488 --> 00:27:14.032
Nava Mahasamut.

00:27:16.023 --> 00:27:18.371
Who’s Lava?

00:27:19.379 --> 00:27:21.006
The guy you met at the counter.

00:27:21.989 --> 00:27:23.428
He’s the owner’s nephew.

00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:26.544
He’s the one who saved my life.

00:27:29.845 --> 00:27:32.857
I’m Natee, or you can call me Tee.

00:27:34.142 --> 00:27:36.608
Nice to meet you, Tee.

00:27:58.847 --> 00:28:02.052
This land belongs to Thai people.

00:28:02.052 --> 00:28:04.120
Foreigners have no rights here.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.269
No outsiders! No outsiders!
DON’T STAY SILENT ABOUT LAND OWNERSHIP.
FIGHT FOR COMMUNITY RIGHTS.
RIGHTS OF THE UNHOUSED.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:12.052
Not allowed!

00:28:12.052 --> 00:28:13.645
Please, District Chief.

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:16.297
I just want our island to stay ours.

00:28:17.204 --> 00:28:19.943
We’ve let too many outsiders
take over already.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.489
Be careful, Peng.

00:28:22.489 --> 00:28:23.551
This could backfire on you.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.687
You yourself are from Bangkok.

00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:27.679
If you don’t marry a local,

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:30.185
they’ll still see you as an outsider too.

00:28:31.369 --> 00:28:32.372
I understand.

00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:36.281
But please, think of me
as representing the villagers.

00:28:37.163 --> 00:28:41.854
Then you’d better find a wife soon
and become one of them.

00:28:41.854 --> 00:28:43.467
Hello, District Chief.

00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:45.862
Hi, Mr. Chet

00:28:46.744 --> 00:28:49.319
Hi, Mr. Peng.

00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:51.239
Hello, Mr. Chetta.

00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:53.665
Just call me casually as Chet.

00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:57.502
Even though we’re rivals,

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:00.500
I see you more as… entertainment.

00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:03.336
We’ll see.

00:29:03.941 --> 00:29:07.084
Maybe we should let the locals decide that.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.081
But I don’t think the locals would vote…

00:29:13.946 --> 00:29:15.134
someone like you as village head.

00:29:17.878 --> 00:29:18.910
Someone like me?

00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:21.697
Like what?

00:29:23.108 --> 00:29:24.488
Nothing.

00:29:25.143 --> 00:29:27.072
Anyway, as I said,

00:29:27.248 --> 00:29:32.192
I find you as…entertainment,
adding color to the race.

00:29:33.452 --> 00:29:34.366
Excuse me.

00:29:34.366 --> 00:29:36.137
I’ve got business with the District Chief.

00:30:12.416 --> 00:30:13.154
Oh, hey.

00:30:14.162 --> 00:30:14.900
Thanks.

00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:16.734
It’s nothing.

00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:18.707
I was just coming to ask for an extra towel.

00:30:19.337 --> 00:30:19.952
Of course.

00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:37.606
I don’t know why,
but you look kind of familiar.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.663
It feels like I’ve seen you somewhere before.

00:30:40.873 --> 00:30:41.711
Where?

00:30:45.314 --> 00:30:46.881
I’m not sure.

00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:50.750
Ever since the incident,
my memory has been hazy.

00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:53.442
You don’t remember anything?

00:30:56.466 --> 00:30:59.328
It just comes in flashes, on and off.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.156
You don’t remember being….

00:31:04.962 --> 00:31:05.891
Being what?

00:31:13.072 --> 00:31:14.843
Wave, open the door!

00:31:18.673 --> 00:31:19.570
Wave!

00:31:22.594 --> 00:31:23.809
Why did you lock the door?

00:31:25.749 --> 00:31:26.656
I didn’t.

00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:28.595
It must have closed from the wind.

00:31:29.124 --> 00:31:31.705
Hey, this is a private area.

00:31:31.705 --> 00:31:32.844
How did you get in here?

00:31:33.373 --> 00:31:35.268
I came to give him my ID card.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.412
I’m sorry.

00:31:39.436 --> 00:31:41.805
Wave, come with me to the hospital.

00:31:42.259 --> 00:31:43.604
I need a tetanus shot.

00:31:44.107 --> 00:31:45.924
Why don’t you wait for Uncle Peng
to come back?

00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:47.064
He can take you.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.134
Or call Tum.

00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:51.601
Why wait? We don’t have to wait.

00:31:52.004 --> 00:31:53.606
Dao can watch the resort.

00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:55.711
But your foot’s still hurt.

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:56.816
Are you sure you can drive?

00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:58.113
Yes.

00:31:58.365 --> 00:31:59.651
You don’t need to worry.

00:32:01.415 --> 00:32:03.707
Hey, come out already.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.029
Let’s go.

00:32:27.588 --> 00:32:28.690
See? You can’t do it.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.340
You’re being stubborn.

00:32:30.995 --> 00:32:33.142
Let’s call Uncle Peng or Tum instead.

00:32:34.225 --> 00:32:35.150
No need.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.449
I don’t want to hear him nag.

00:32:36.903 --> 00:32:38.058
Also, Tum is busy anyway.

00:32:38.309 --> 00:32:40.955
Alright, I’ll call a songthaew for you then.

00:32:41.207 --> 00:32:42.855
I said no.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.496
Stop being stubborn. Look at yourself.

00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:48.071
I can help.

00:32:48.071 --> 00:32:49.975
With your foot hurting like this,
it’ll only get worse.

00:32:50.504 --> 00:32:51.442
I can drive you there.

00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:54.772
It’s fine. You’re on vacation.

00:32:55.729 --> 00:32:57.978
It’s really no problem.
I don’t have any plans anyway.

00:32:58.457 --> 00:33:00.870
It’s fine. I can take care of myself.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:01.792
It’s really no problem.

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:02.794
I can go by myself.

00:33:02.794 --> 00:33:05.107
I’d really like to experience local life
while I’m here.

00:33:05.258 --> 00:33:06.296
Let me take you there.

00:33:06.296 --> 00:33:07.499
I’m fine like this.

00:33:07.499 --> 00:33:09.293
Hey, just let him take you, okay?

00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:12.412
Thanks a lot.

00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:15.273
But how are the three of us getting there?

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:17.553
Riding triple is dangerous.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.226
I said it’s fine!

00:34:12.957 --> 00:34:16.903
I told you not to mess with those kids.

00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:19.105
You almost ended up a ghost
haunting this island.

00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:20.946
Can you not yell at me too?

00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:24.256
I’ve been scolded all day already.

00:34:24.401 --> 00:34:26.072
Nobody even tried to comfort me.

00:34:26.506 --> 00:34:27.085
Eh?

00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:28.709
Then get your partner to comfort you.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.334
Partner? I don’t have one.

00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:34.174
Wave isn’t your partner?

00:34:35.476 --> 00:34:36.366
You knew?

00:34:37.017 --> 00:34:38.016
Of course I knew.

00:34:38.432 --> 00:34:39.988
I’ve seen everything.

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:42.976
You two are obviously together.

00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:46.636
Like you and Tum?

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.900
Ha! Me and Tum?
We’re more like karmic debts.

00:34:53.914 --> 00:34:56.936
I just wish he’d grow up
and take life seriously.

00:34:57.641 --> 00:34:59.410
Then give him a chance.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.508
He’s been trying to change for you.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.205
Support his influencer dream a little.

00:35:04.946 --> 00:35:06.675
Who knows?

00:35:06.832 --> 00:35:09.427
He might become
a big online seller someday.

00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:13.128
You could be dripping in gold chains.

00:35:14.755 --> 00:35:16.333
Wow, you’re really on his side, huh?

00:35:16.659 --> 00:35:18.597
You two are way too alike.

00:35:18.752 --> 00:35:19.858
Let me give you another shot.

00:35:19.858 --> 00:35:20.450
No, no!

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:21.761
- One more, okay?
- No!

00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:23.455
- Let me do it.
- Stop. I said no!

00:35:24.016 --> 00:35:24.809
Hey,

00:35:25.569 --> 00:35:27.320
you don’t need to lecture me.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.054
Worry about yourself.

00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:32.622
Taking advantage to make him your boyfriend while he remembers nothing?

00:35:33.074 --> 00:35:34.546
Be careful.

00:35:34.546 --> 00:35:36.037
One day, someone may reclaim him.

00:35:44.623 --> 00:35:46.298
You don’t have to wait for us.

00:35:46.876 --> 00:35:48.342
We can head back ourselves.

00:35:49.499 --> 00:35:51.055
I think Lava is feeling better now.

00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:54.277
It’s fine. I can wait.

00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:55.646
I really don’t have plans.

00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:59.720
I’d like to get to know this place
and you a little better.

00:36:01.818 --> 00:36:03.593
There’s nothing that interesting about me.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.588
But I find you interesting.

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:16.193
All done.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.810
Let’s go home.

00:36:31.161 --> 00:36:32.487
Are you sure you can drive?

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.390
You’re not going to crash on a turn, right?

00:36:35.032 --> 00:36:36.311
I told you, I’m fine.

00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:37.893
This wound is nothing.

00:36:40.045 --> 00:36:43.064
If you can go back,
I’ll go my own way here.

00:36:44.113 --> 00:36:46.179
Where are you going?

00:36:47.228 --> 00:36:49.231
Just to a nearby beach.

00:36:49.231 --> 00:36:50.725
I want to find a beautiful sea to swim in.

00:36:51.665 --> 00:36:53.222
There are plenty of beaches here,

00:36:53.746 --> 00:36:55.819
but I know one I want to recommend.

00:36:56.126 --> 00:36:58.212
It’s really beautiful and private.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.312
Should we take him there?

00:37:00.312 --> 00:37:01.990
You’re really volunteering yourself, huh?

00:37:02.152 --> 00:37:03.739
He didn’t even ask for help.

00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:04.552
Why bother?

00:37:05.872 --> 00:37:08.475
If you want us to take you,
I’ll have to charge a guide fee.

00:37:09.054 --> 00:37:10.237
Why would you charge him?

00:37:10.237 --> 00:37:11.859
He came alone.

00:37:12.637 --> 00:37:15.856
Also, he’s the one
who drove you to the hospital.

00:37:18.297 --> 00:37:19.590
It’s okay, really.

00:37:20.837 --> 00:37:24.031
Lava must be tired. He should rest.

00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:26.426
Rest?

00:37:27.023 --> 00:37:29.346
He just said the wound is nothing.

00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:31.287
Come on, let’s go.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.309
Ugh.

00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:09.836
You’re right, this beach is stunning.

00:38:10.794 --> 00:38:11.872
Thanks for bringing me here.

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:13.984
I’m going to go for a swim.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.669
Wow, you’re in great shape.

00:38:25.778 --> 00:38:28.003
What do you do for work?

00:38:28.455 --> 00:38:30.471
I used to be a soldier.

00:38:30.792 --> 00:38:31.692
That explains it.

00:38:32.488 --> 00:38:33.866
I wish I had a body like yours.

00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:35.951
Didn’t you say the other day
you liked your own body just fine?

00:38:36.112 --> 00:38:37.888
You said you’re small, easy to carry.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.643
You don’t want to be carried anymore, huh?

00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:41.494
But he’s in such good shape.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.395
Look. He’s perfectly lean.

00:38:44.395 --> 00:38:45.710
Not that much.

00:38:46.108 --> 00:38:47.275
Just wait until I bulk up.

00:38:48.342 --> 00:38:50.399
I’ll be huge like King Kong.

00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:53.115
Do you want to go swimming together?

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:56.210
Sure. We came all this way.

00:39:01.942 --> 00:39:03.385
Take care of it for me.

00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:07.141
My watch too.

00:39:07.448 --> 00:39:08.378
I’m coming too.

00:39:08.712 --> 00:39:09.495
Don’t.

00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:12.370
Your foot is not fully healed yet. Stay here.

00:39:14.956 --> 00:39:15.686
Let’s go.

00:39:24.472 --> 00:39:25.155
Hey!

00:39:26.945 --> 00:39:28.342
Don’t hold hands!

00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:31.597
Wave, let go!

00:39:32.031 --> 00:39:34.240
Back off a bit. That’s too close!

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.144
Wave!

00:39:54.138 --> 00:39:55.712
The sea here really is beautiful.

00:39:56.887 --> 00:39:59.883
I told you. Everything here is amazing.

00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:06.190
Don’t you ever think about
finding your family?

00:40:07.962 --> 00:40:09.238
I tried.

00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:13.754
I just wonder if there’s anyone left.

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:18.830
I just want to know if there’s anyone
who really loves and cares about me.

00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:22.215
I don’t get why no one ever came
looking for me.

00:40:23.698 --> 00:40:26.608
Maybe they’re just waiting for the right time.

00:40:28.561 --> 00:40:29.621
The right time?

00:40:31.502 --> 00:40:32.462
What time are you talking about?

00:40:37.952 --> 00:40:38.978
It’s fine though.

00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:42.387
I’m happy here.

00:40:43.147 --> 00:40:48.846
I’ve got friends, a job I like, good food,

00:40:50.257 --> 00:40:53.814
and a boyfriend.

00:40:57.152 --> 00:40:59.031
You should try living here for three months.

00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:03.342
You might feel like heaven just like I do.

00:41:44.086 --> 00:41:44.885
Lava!

00:41:50.021 --> 00:41:50.642
Wave!

00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:53.320
Wave!

00:41:55.653 --> 00:41:56.399
Wave!

00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:57.206
Wave!

00:41:59.014 --> 00:41:59.679
Wave!

00:42:01.343 --> 00:42:02.075
Wave!

00:42:03.015 --> 00:42:03.734
Wave!

00:42:07.152 --> 00:42:07.826
Wave!

00:42:09.092 --> 00:42:09.791
Wave!

00:42:11.346 --> 00:42:12.122
Wave!

00:42:13.352 --> 00:42:14.125
Wave!

00:42:14.252 --> 00:42:14.943
Wave!

00:42:15.088 --> 00:42:15.849
Wave!

00:42:15.994 --> 00:42:16.871
Lava!

00:42:20.741 --> 00:42:21.376
Wave!

00:42:23.058 --> 00:42:23.957
What happened?

00:42:30.624 --> 00:42:32.343
I went out to swim and got a cramp.

00:42:33.482 --> 00:42:35.833
Good thing Natee helped me,

00:42:37.352 --> 00:42:39.398
or the waves would’ve carried me far out.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.730
I didn’t even notice.

00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:44.110
The waves were too strong.

00:42:44.906 --> 00:42:45.536
Let go.

00:42:50.816 --> 00:42:52.733
You’re not a strong swimmer.

00:42:53.257 --> 00:42:54.627
How did you go that far out?

00:42:56.851 --> 00:42:58.074
I got a bit carried away.

00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:04.339
Right side hurting, right?

00:43:25.584 --> 00:43:26.580
Feeling any better?

00:43:32.152 --> 00:43:33.509
You can’t do this.

00:43:33.997 --> 00:43:35.285
I was worried sick.

00:43:37.383 --> 00:43:39.716
You know you’re not a strong swimmer,
yet you still mess around.

00:43:41.669 --> 00:43:43.281
You can’t mess around with the sea.

00:43:48.361 --> 00:43:49.694
No matter what,

00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:54.002
no outsider can protect you better than I can.

00:44:00.606 --> 00:44:04.635
So if you’re going somewhere,
I need to be there with you.

00:44:06.823 --> 00:44:07.451
Yeah.

00:44:36.262 --> 00:44:36.990
Eh?

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.849
Hey, why are you coming in here?

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:41.970
Wait until I finish showering.

00:44:42.158 --> 00:44:43.174
I’m showering with you.

00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:50.387
Your foot’s injured, right?

00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:52.115
Can it get wet?

00:44:52.751 --> 00:44:53.716
Never mind.

00:44:55.223 --> 00:44:56.447
No, don’t.

00:45:00.143 --> 00:45:00.830
Why?

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.635
Are you rushing to smell good
to watch the movie with that foreign guy?

00:45:07.107 --> 00:45:08.305
Are you jealous of me and Natee?

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.344
Yes, very jealous.

00:45:12.568 --> 00:45:14.400
I did it on purpose.

00:45:18.214 --> 00:45:20.275
Whoa, that’s sneaky.

00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:22.420
I wanted to test you too.

00:45:22.844 --> 00:45:26.130
You can test me, so I can test you.

00:45:26.436 --> 00:45:28.750
I already protected you from those thugs.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:30.373
Isn’t that proof enough?

00:45:32.398 --> 00:45:37.940
I just want to know what we are.

00:45:40.812 --> 00:45:42.945
Life debt to repay?

00:45:44.922 --> 00:45:46.682
Friends helping at the resort?

00:45:48.895 --> 00:45:52.378
Or just your holiday romance?

00:45:55.485 --> 00:45:56.399
We’re boyfriends!

00:45:57.811 --> 00:45:58.790
Boyfriends!

00:45:59.732 --> 00:46:02.879
You’re my boyfriend!

00:46:02.879 --> 00:46:05.985
Boyfriend!

00:46:06.362 --> 00:46:07.330
Hey. I got it.

00:46:18.911 --> 00:46:21.001
Even though Natee saved my life today,

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.603
it can’t compare to you giving me a new life.

00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:44.471
I’ll scrub your back.

00:46:50.074 --> 00:46:52.355
How do people without partners
even do that?

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.973
I don’t know. I have a boyfriend.

00:47:18.778 --> 00:47:21.109
Tong, can you wait for me
to graduate next year?

00:47:21.274 --> 00:47:24.114
Then we can start fresh.

00:47:25.566 --> 00:47:26.269
Yeah.

00:47:28.246 --> 00:47:29.624
I can wait for you.

00:47:32.708 --> 00:47:35.977
I hope we won’t mess this up again.

00:47:40.685 --> 00:47:44.442
I hope we grab this chance.

00:47:53.902 --> 00:47:57.285
If you ever get to date your crush,
where would you take them?

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:02.997
Me?

00:48:03.185 --> 00:48:04.059
Uh-huh.

00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:09.006
Someone like me, with no money,
can’t do anything fancy.

00:48:13.126 --> 00:48:15.552
At most, I’d just take them out on a boat,

00:48:15.552 --> 00:48:18.300
go diving to see the coral and pufferfish,

00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:22.664
cook a meal from the fish I catch,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.042
then end the night catching squid and watching the stars together.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:34.356
That actually sounds like your kind of low-budget romance.

00:48:34.992 --> 00:48:36.873
But who would want that with me?

00:48:41.063 --> 00:48:42.120
Who knows?

00:48:42.238 --> 00:48:45.279
Maybe one day I’ll want to try dating you

00:48:45.561 --> 00:48:47.280
because I like diving

00:48:47.656 --> 00:48:50.616
and stargazing out at sea.

00:48:55.513 --> 00:48:56.937
But I don’t like you.

00:49:05.244 --> 00:49:06.481
I must be crazy if I don’t.

00:49:09.682 --> 00:49:10.954
- You idiot!
- Ouch.

00:49:11.284 --> 00:49:12.585
Just eat.

00:49:15.222 --> 00:49:17.031
You’re the most beautiful on this island.

00:49:29.628 --> 00:49:35.157
Doc, I think people already know about us.

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:41.625
They were talking about it at the market
and at the district office.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:45.843
You really heard that?

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:48.626
They were even teasing.

00:49:54.276 --> 00:49:56.862
Do you think the director knows?

00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:00.474
He hasn’t said anything to me.

00:50:03.322 --> 00:50:05.060
I think you shouldn’t worry.

00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:09.064
It’s better if others know.

00:50:09.229 --> 00:50:10.782
We don’t have to hide.

00:50:13.324 --> 00:50:16.193
Running from problems has no end.

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:18.404
Let’s face them together.

00:50:19.981 --> 00:50:20.747
Alright?

00:50:26.993 --> 00:50:27.929
Don’t overthink it.

00:51:01.667 --> 00:51:03.021
Why are you up so early?

00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:05.300
I’m helping you cast nets.

00:51:05.865 --> 00:51:07.170
Don’t bother calling Tum.

00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:09.500
He took Kratae out
for late-night tea yesterday.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.157
Is your foot all healed now?

00:51:15.958 --> 00:51:19.412
Yeah. I know I can’t stay weak for long.

00:51:24.285 --> 00:51:30.539
Anyway, thanks a lot for handling those guys
who came to pick a fight.

00:51:31.222 --> 00:51:32.590
Wave told me everything.

00:51:34.026 --> 00:51:35.872
I was just doing my job.

00:51:36.178 --> 00:51:37.611
If I’m going to be village head,

00:51:37.752 --> 00:51:39.800
I’ve got to keep everyone safe.

00:51:41.244 --> 00:51:42.942
Don’t act all cool, Uncle.

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:44.919
My house registration isn’t here.

00:51:44.919 --> 00:51:46.082
I can’t vote for you.

00:51:47.847 --> 00:51:48.626
You little punk.

00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:03.185
Hey!

00:52:03.985 --> 00:52:05.533
What’s that, Uncle?

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.654
What’s going on?

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.062
Stay in the car, okay?

00:52:23.487 --> 00:52:26.648
Wait. What if he’s a thief?

00:52:26.648 --> 00:52:27.377
Hey!

00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:31.675
Help! Somebody help me, please!

00:52:31.793 --> 00:52:32.688
Uncle!

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.474
Help!

00:52:39.181 --> 00:52:40.041
Please help me!

00:52:48.424 --> 00:52:50.223
Uncle, watch out!

00:53:10.531 --> 00:53:11.274
Hey!

00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:30.629
BANGSAWAN ISLAND SCHOOL

00:53:36.611 --> 00:53:37.956
You don’t have to be jealous anymore.

00:53:38.638 --> 00:53:41.780
Natee checked out this morning.

00:53:42.557 --> 00:53:45.871
He booked three days but stayed only one.

00:53:47.142 --> 00:53:49.853
I guess he didn’t like the island that much,

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:54.656
or maybe he’s just scared of you.

00:53:55.998 --> 00:53:58.115
Scared? I haven’t even done anything.

00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:01.367
I kind of wanted him to stay.

00:54:02.544 --> 00:54:04.020
I like it when you get jealous.

00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:11.738
Come pick me up later, okay?

00:54:12.185 --> 00:54:12.857
Yeah.

00:54:23.684 --> 00:54:24.319
Wave!

00:54:27.521 --> 00:54:29.705
Hmm? What is it?

00:54:32.954 --> 00:54:36.094
I finished work today, so I asked Uncle Peng
to let me watch you.

00:54:38.283 --> 00:54:42.145
Wait. What did you just call me?

00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.568
You, in a polite way.

00:54:49.664 --> 00:54:50.515
Well,

00:54:53.811 --> 00:54:55.282
we’re dating now, right?

00:54:55.753 --> 00:54:57.733
I just want to sound polite,

00:54:57.733 --> 00:54:58.838
like you always do with me.

00:55:01.475 --> 00:55:04.343
But it doesn’t feel right.

00:55:05.379 --> 00:55:06.586
It doesn’t sound like you at all.

00:55:08.658 --> 00:55:11.292
Honestly, I don’t mind.

00:55:13.293 --> 00:55:16.223
I like you better when you’re rough.

00:55:18.577 --> 00:55:20.567
No, I want to talk nicely.

00:55:24.545 --> 00:55:26.837
Alright then, whatever you want.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.872
Lava, look.

00:55:55.178 --> 00:55:57.456
Aomsin’s gotten so much better at playing.

00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:00.997
I bet he’ll get into
the provincial school for sure.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.287
I wouldn’t be this good without you, Teacher.

00:56:05.441 --> 00:56:07.792
You’ve been practicing hard, Aomsin.

00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:10.364
Give yourself credit, not me.

00:56:10.505 --> 00:56:12.278
Whoa. You’re so cool!

00:56:21.243 --> 00:56:24.239
Dance with me.

00:56:25.345 --> 00:56:26.790
I’m so happy today.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.244
Oh, come on.

00:56:29.809 --> 00:56:32.164
I learned it in high school,

00:56:33.694 --> 00:56:35.930
but I can’t dance anymore.

00:56:36.471 --> 00:56:37.598
It’s fine.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.972
No one is judging.

00:56:39.972 --> 00:56:41.343
Just dance with how you feel.

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.526
Princess Anya sent me here
to see if her younger brother,

00:56:48.526 --> 00:56:50.525
Prince Davin, is safe.

00:56:53.609 --> 00:56:54.593
Prince who?

00:56:56.264 --> 00:56:59.550
Prince Davin, heir to the throne of Arantha.

00:57:03.411 --> 00:57:04.669
Prince Davin?

00:57:06.364 --> 00:57:07.823
The one you know as Wave.

00:57:24.321 --> 00:57:28.335
You’re saying Wave is a prince?

00:57:28.712 --> 00:57:29.374
Yes.

00:57:29.892 --> 00:57:32.766
I think he was attacked and lost his memory.

00:57:39.734 --> 00:57:40.742
I don’t believe it.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.704
You made that up, didn’t you?

00:57:43.245 --> 00:57:44.946
I also wish it weren’t true.

00:57:45.393 --> 00:57:48.152
But right now, the prince’s life is in danger.

00:57:49.353 --> 00:57:52.402
The prince’s family has been imprisoned
in the palace by the rebels,

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:54.161
cut off from the outside world.

00:58:00.823 --> 00:58:03.242
If everything you said is true,

00:58:03.572 --> 00:58:04.795
what do you want us to do?

00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:08.677
Please take care of the prince
the best you can

00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:10.926
until things in the palace settle down.

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:14.766
After that, I’ll come back to take him home
as soon as possible.

00:58:17.244 --> 00:58:18.513
You trust us?

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.890
Of course. I can read people.

00:58:23.244 --> 00:58:26.799
I can see how much you both
love and care for him.

00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:36.458
But from now on, you must act normal.

00:58:37.047 --> 00:58:39.430
Never let the prince discover
who he really is.

00:58:48.714 --> 00:58:49.641
What are you thinking about?

00:58:53.244 --> 00:58:56.764
That I’ve never danced before.

00:58:59.871 --> 00:59:01.065
This is my first time.

00:59:08.609 --> 00:59:09.475
How does it feel?

00:59:10.534 --> 00:59:11.638
Feels good, right?

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.224
Trying something new for the first time.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.345
It’s also my first time

00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:43.551
feeling love for someone.

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.529
I love you too.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:37.102
You’re just an ordinary guy.

01:00:37.102 --> 01:00:38.488
He’s a prince.

01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:40.305
I want you to be ready for that, okay?

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:42.339
Can I just not cut it, Uncle?

01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:45.881
I’ve got an important job, watching over my prince.

01:00:46.399 --> 01:00:48.141
FAGGOT
Who do you think did it?

01:00:48.259 --> 01:00:49.455
Probably a rival.

01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:51.009
I guess they saw Uncle Peng getting popular.

01:00:51.009 --> 01:00:52.856
Come out and talk, Peng!

01:00:52.856 --> 01:00:55.006
You’ve been seeing my son for a year behind my back!

01:00:55.006 --> 01:00:56.349
You really humiliated me!

01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:58.555
I just saw Wave kiss your cheek.

01:00:58.555 --> 01:00:59.853
Are you sure you’re just friends?

01:00:59.853 --> 01:01:01.098
He’s my boyfriend

01:01:01.098 --> 01:01:03.050
I like it when you’re this gentle.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.954
You’re the only one who gets to see me like this.
