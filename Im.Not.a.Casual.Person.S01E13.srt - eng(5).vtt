00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.759
Your current condition is very unstable.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.360
Please minimize emotional fluctuations.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.800
Limit how often you go out.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.460
Avoid sudden deterioration of your condition.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
The doctor says

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.820
we need to increase your medication dosage.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.700
I am a businessman.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.220
Finding good projects

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.880
and good actors to work with

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.120
is my job.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.840
Anything beyond that,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.490
I couldn't care less about.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.520
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.440
I really want to tell you that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.760
I like you.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.240
I've said before,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.760
as long as you don't give up hope,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.690
there's still hope for the future.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.160
Shen Yifan,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.720
just you wait and see.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.680
I have someone I like.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.420
Miss Zheng truly has a passionate personality.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.500
Are you still in Switzerland?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.000
Help me find someone.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.480
Sweetie.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.720
Mommy's back.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.600
Mom, Dad and I have been waiting for you.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.240
Dad?

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.760
Well...

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.210
I just happened to run into him, so I kept him company for a while.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.760
Come here, sweetie.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.980
What are you doing?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.260
There's no such coincidence.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520
Mom, don't be angry.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.320
I wanted Dad to play with me.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.570
If you want to play, I can play with you.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.000
And you can't just call someone Dad.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.810
Understand?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.600
But Mom, I really like Dad.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.480
Don't overthink it.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.410
I was just keeping the kid company.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.560
Thank you for your kindness.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.050
I appreciate it.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.360
I'll be going then.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.040
Mr. Shen.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.560
Your readings are much better today.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.159
Staying away from that annoying Zheng Ying was the right choice.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.040
But I don't feel good.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.160
Mr. Shen.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.560
Are you alright?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.020
What's on the schedule today?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.810
The variety show we discussed before starts filming today.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.610
I'll take her to the set.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.480
Mr. Shen.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.720
You don't need to go.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.520
Why not?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.360
Zheng Ying said

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.440
you don't need to see her off.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.560
What else did she say?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.440
We're just business partners.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.900
Why are you still so involved in my business?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.680
By the way,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.280
that line is really good.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.080
This line

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.840
was specially added by our scriptwriter

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.280
and it's the key moment

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.400
in today's filming.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.060
We're aiming to trend online.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.610
Good.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.080
You two go over your lines again.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.440
We'll start shooting soon.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.880
Okay.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.000
These game-based variety shows are

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.200
extremely popular now.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.930
We must do a good job recording.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.920
Recording...

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.440
Hey!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.600
What's wrong with you?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.600
At yesterday's film festival,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.560
you were the center of attention as a new actress.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.720
How come

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.720
after trending for just a few hours,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.650
you're already acting like a diva?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400
Diva...

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.890
Weren't you supposed to be the hunter?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.000
But you look more like the prey to me.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.680
Prey...

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.100
If you keep this up,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.320
I'm going to complain to Director Shen.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.610
This is basically her state right now.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.960
But the crew is very satisfied.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.200
They say she's very cooperative.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.520
Whatever the crew asks, she films it.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.760
Nonsense.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.400
Should we help her?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.280
No need.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.530
She needs time to calm down.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.400
They're playing games today.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.960
Losers get thrown into the water.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.720
She volunteered to go into the water

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.780
and wouldn't let Wan Yuchen help her.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.290
How ridiculous.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.600
Should we go check on her?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.250
What's there to see?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.400
Have you finished your work?

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.720
Mr. Shen.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.520
Wan Yuchen said she was doing an escape room game

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.320
and volunteered to chase after a non-player character,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.480
but then a prop fell and injured her.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.720
What?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.970
She got injured.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.840
This photo of yours

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.000
looks so fake.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.159
How about this? Real enough for you?

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.090
Take it quickly.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.400
I really don't understand why I'm not sleeping at this hour

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.930
and accompanying you with all this nonsense.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.360
Hiking up mountains, going into water.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.720
And now pretending to be injured?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.680
All this effort to play the victim,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.810
who exactly are you trying to impress?

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.760
Is it that person?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.720
Shut your mouth

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.040
and stop gossiping about me.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.840
Otherwise...

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.200
Here.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.800
You know who I'll send this to.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.640
It's been hours

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.400
and he still hasn't come.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.560
Does he think I'm not injured badly enough?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.560
This cold-hearted man.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.800
Master Zhou says

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.280
a martial artist shouldn't mind this little pain.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.120
Self-harm

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.780
is absolutely unacceptable.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.840
I'd better call and ask.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.560
Hello,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.360
Shen Yifan.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.680
Where are you now?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.320
I...

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.760
I'm in my room at the film set.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.640
Wait for me.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.970
I'll be right there.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.200
I knew it.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.820
He would definitely come.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.200
You're here.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.480
Come here.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.650
What kind of person are you?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.720
I'm injured

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.320
and you won't even help me up.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.180
I guess I'll walk over by myself then.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.520
You haven't been to the set for days.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.940
Why did you come today?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.850
Didn't you say you were injured

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.410
and asked me to come see you?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.600
Yes.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.920
I'm injured. It really hurts.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.140
Someone who's injured wouldn't be wearing high heels.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.450
What do you want from me?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.080
Nothing.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.120
I just haven't seen you for days

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.580
and I miss you a little.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.960
At the film festival opening ceremony,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.400
I made myself very clear.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.920
I know.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.360
Your position

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.400
is perfectly clear to me.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920
But,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.400
just as I can't

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.040
force you to like me,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.880
you can't stop me from liking you either.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.200
I think you're doing the right thing.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.760
Just keep going like this.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.560
If you persist a little longer,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.080
you'll complete your plan

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.280
and we can leave.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.760
What if I can't hold on anymore?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.690
I find that the harder I try,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.300
the more I can't let her go.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.480
I truly like you.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.560
You may be perfect,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.400
but I'm pretty great too.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.840
So,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.560
you really need to think about this carefully.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.220
What if you end up missing out on someone like me,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.560
who's smart and beautiful?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.360
You won't even have a chance to regret it later.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.480
I don't want to have regrets.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.620
I don't want to miss out on her.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.610
I want to throw caution to the wind just this once.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.800
Since you're being so stubborn,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.340
then I'll... listen to me.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.840
So no matter what,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.970
I can't stop you from liking me, right?

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.720
Fine.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
Then listen to me.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.440
I'm willing to use all my resources to build you up.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.160
And I'm in a hurry to make you famous

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.560
because I have a congenital heart disease.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.360
Before long,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.440
I'll be dead.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.980
Are you scared now?

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.560
This is who I am.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.570
Do you still like me?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.000
Do you dare to like me now?

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.480
After all this nonsense,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.880
I'm getting hungry.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.250
Want to go get something to eat?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.840
He's sick

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.970
with only a few months left to live.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320
Shen Yifan,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.680
how dare you make up such a lie!

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.880
[Yan A·222U5]

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.880
Do you think you're a screenwriter making up stories?

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.440
Even if you were writing fiction,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.000
I haven't seen such

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.930
clichéd plots in nearly ten years.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.080
Shen Yifan,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.280
you big liar!

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.520
Liar!

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.440
How's that investigation I asked you to do?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.240
About Shen Yifan you asked me to look into,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.080
he's practically a legend in the investment world.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.080
I heard he was a child prodigy,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.960
with an extremely high IQ.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.720
Mr. Zhou,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.400
let's skip these details about Mr. Shen.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.320
Focus on other aspects.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.160
Other aspects?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.960
Like any weaknesses, for example.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.120
There aren't any.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.080
There must be.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.840
Keep digging.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.560
That 'Drunken Jade Mountain' project,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960
the writing team we found is quite efficient.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.160
I didn't expect them to deliver the adaptation plan so quickly.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.400
Send it to Yiping Sunshine for approval as soon as possible,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.440
then keep an eye on the writing team

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.720
to produce an outline quickly.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.920
No problem.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.520
If things continue to go this smoothly,

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.040
I believe it won't be long

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.440
before we see the script

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.560
and start filming.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.200
In that case,

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.060
we'll be one big step closer to completing our plan.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.920
There are too many unpredictable factors.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.520
Let's push forward quickly.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.300
How's the variety show coming along?

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.200
Why would anyone ship us together?

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.720
A couple pairing can be unpopular,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.520
but this is just bizarre.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.240
Director,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.760
this is truly a heaven-sent opportunity.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.359
Look.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.079
If we can capture more footage

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.760
of their interactions,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.359
we'll have our trending topic.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.319
With a hot topic,

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.319
our show's popularity

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.250
will skyrocket.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.839
Mr. Shen clearly stated

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.480
not to hype up romantic relationships.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.880
We just won't do it openly, problem solved.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.440
What if they really shoot it this way?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.599
What will we do?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.000
Now, you two need to figure out a way

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.800
to eat the peanuts in your plates.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.330
Both of you need to eat them.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.520
Look.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.320
I got it! I ate it!

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.520
Yuchen,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.480
Zhengying seems a bit cold now.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.600
Shouldn't you take off your jacket

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.600
and give it to her?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.720
I'm not cold at all.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.200
I'm actually very hot.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.600
Alright, alright.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.680
That's a wrap!

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.240
Let me ask you something.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.840
If a man tells you

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.440
that he has a serious illness,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.570
what does that mean?

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.360
He's a jerk.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.160
No.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.420
Then he's a player.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.400
When a man wants to leave a woman

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.600
but doesn't want to say he doesn't like her anymore,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.920
he often uses three excuses.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.120
Family disapproval.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.240
Business failure.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.960
And

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.120
having cancer.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.920
So,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.660
you also think he's lying?

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.320
If I encounter this situation,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960
what should I do?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.360
Just like what we did today,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.720
quietly expose his lies.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.570
Could the information online be inaccurate?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.800
Come in.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.280
Hello, doctor.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.080
What seems to be the problem?

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.680
I'm not sick.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.120
I'm just here to ask something for someone else.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.480
Regarding the feedback on the adaptation proposal.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.920
That's all I have for now.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.680
Please make these revisions when you get back.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.520
If he really has heart disease,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.880
he should be taking some medication for it, right?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.760
I knew it.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.520
Heart disease? Yeah, right.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.120
He's definitely lying to me.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680
Doctor, what else?

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.760
If a person's neck

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.800
has a visible vein running from the collarbone

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.200
up toward the earlobe,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.420
about as thick as a little finger,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.640
it could indicate right heart failure.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.740
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.560
My neck doesn't feel right.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.420
I think I slept on it wrong.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.400
That neck.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.360
Some heart disease patients

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.760
may develop enlargement

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.220
of their fingers and toes,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.600
with nails that bulge like drumsticks.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.520
I've been learning the I Ching from Wan Yuchen lately.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.650
I can read palms now.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.920
Want me to read yours?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.220
Great, you agreed.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.440
Is this palm reading

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.440
or are you just taking advantage of me?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.370
I'm definitely taking advantage.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.400
Of course I'm reading your palm.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.240
All done.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.220
Nothing wrong.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.520
You still haven't told me

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.890
why you've really come back this time.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.900
What could I possibly be up to?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.480
What kind of trouble were you expecting?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.320
Well,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.380
if there's nothing else, I'll head back to the film set.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.720
Hello?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.960
Yes, it's me.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.920
The production team.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.160
I knew he wasn't really sick.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040
Seriously.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.960
Then why did he lie to me?

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.280
Mr. Cheng.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.400
What is it?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.240
Zheng Ying.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.720
I regret to tell you some bad news.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.320
Your boss, Shen Yifan,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.240
has a serious heart condition.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.320
I don't think he's right for you.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.920
What?

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.960
To make me believe he's really sick,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.200
now you're also lying to me with him.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:36.840
Hey.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.560
If I want to stay by her side,

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.290
I need to figure something out.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.480
Linda.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.080
Mr. Cheng, what is it?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.200
Notify the home gym

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.520
I'm starting to work out today.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.410
Have the trainer ready.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.720
Go ahead.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.260
Zheng Ying.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:07.960
You left the production team

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.240
without notifying Yu Youyi or me,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.480
on your own.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.960
And the production team called saying

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.080
you're not following the script at all.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.640
Why?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.560
Because I hate lying

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.820
and I hate being lied to even more.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.240
What was my purpose in taking this show?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.160
Wasn't it to distinguish myself from being just an actress

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.520
and show my true self?

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.560
You're too naive.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.200
No reality show

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.760
can be completely authentic.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.720
And no one

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.640
can be completely themselves

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.880
in front of cameras.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.360
Fans can edit and ship however they want,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.640
that's their freedom.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.680
But I absolutely will not

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.080
cater to some show effect

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.800
by deliberately misleading them.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.400
After all,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.880
fake is fake,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.340
and lies will always be exposed eventually.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.900
I know everything now,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.280
so you don't need to deceive me

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.040
by pretending to be a heart patient

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.480
and getting others to help you lie to me.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.340
Is it really that serious?

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.040
Shen Yifan, I just want to ask you,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.100
why did you lie to me about being sick?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.920
What was the real reason?

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.120
Shen Yifan.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.880
You never liked me,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.280
did you?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.760
Shen Yifan.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.920
Wasn't there even one moment when you had feelings for me?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040
Just say there was.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:36.880
No.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.480
How is that possible?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.320
You clearly...

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:41.980
Zheng Ying,

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.050
I've never had romantic feelings for you.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.920
I never, never,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.640
never liked you that way.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.000
If my feelings

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.100
make you this uncomfortable,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.930
then I'd rather give up.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.320
I was wrong before.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.840
I shouldn't have kept pursuing you

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.930
after you clearly rejected me.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.680
From now on,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:27.920
we'll just be

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.250
in a normal boss-employee relationship.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.360
I won't cross the line again.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.320
But I should warn you,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960
I won't be able

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.420
to get over my feelings for you that quickly.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.280
So,

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.680
I might still get drunk

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.010
and call you sometimes.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.370
Just do what you did before -

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.040
ignore me completely.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.000
Or be kind enough

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.240
to call Yu Youyi to pick me up.
