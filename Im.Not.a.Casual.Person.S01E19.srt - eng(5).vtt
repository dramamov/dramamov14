WEBVTT

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.840
Coming!

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.440
Regarding the recent drama on set,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.840
do you have any comments?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600
Are the online rumors true?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.160
Excuse me, please make way.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.680
Is it true that Mr. Cheng Dong fainted on set

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.039
because of you?

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.280
Is Mr. Cheng's resignation related to you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.560
and your financial backers?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.120
What you're doing

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.360
could this be considered disrespect to seniors and workplace bullying?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.760
Were you at the filming location?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.560
Did you see it with your own eyes?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.640
You're not a legitimate media outlet, are you?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.880
You're drawing conclusions based on one-sided information.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940
Is this your professional standard?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.920
Your question just now constitutes defamation.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
I reserve the right

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.360
to take legal action.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.020
Heaven sees everything we do.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.220
What's wrong can never be made right.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.340
The truth won't stay hidden forever.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Mind what you do.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
I'm sorry.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.040
I rushed back as soon as I saw the news.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.370
Regarding this matter,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.320
don't respond to it anymore.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.480
Why?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.930
He's clearly turning the tables on me.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.560
Why would he turn the tables on you?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.620
To shift the blame,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160
to ride on the publicity,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.360
what else could it be?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.960
Exactly.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.400
Riding on publicity.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.680
The more you respond,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.810
the more attention he gets.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920
So I'm supposed to do nothing?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.080
Why should I?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.840
Why should he use his seniority

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.480
to smear my reputation?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.000
Why should I be slandered

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.330
and just have to take it?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.920
Not all grievances can be voiced.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.640
Not all truths

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.040
can be known to everyone.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.079
Think about it.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.520
If he gets what he wants,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.650
what will he do next?

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.120
He'll stick to you like glue,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.440
whenever he needs to,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.840
he'll drag you out to humiliate you.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.500
I don't want to tolerate this.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.040
Not at all.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.140
It's not about tolerance.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.400
To be precise,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680
it's about giving him the cold shoulder.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.600
That's the wisest approach right now.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.920
At a time like this,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.480
who cares about being wise?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.520
I don't care who he is.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.600
Let's just confront him and be done with it.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.860
You might feel better,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.120
but who will clean up the mess?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.960
Shen Yifan?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.120
Do you really want him to deal with all this?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.850
We don't necessarily need to clean up afterward.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480
How could we not?

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:56.960
Think about it.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.440
What would be the consequences of a direct confrontation?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.120
What would people say about you?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.040
Aggressive,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.840
unforgiving even when right,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.300
disrespectful to elders.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.690
Doesn't Cheng Dong have connections behind him?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.320
In the end, both sides will lose.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.960
Do you think Shen Yifan wouldn't step in to handle it?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.640
Yes,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800
people in the industry would respect him.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.440
But

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.450
if there's a need in the future,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.770
wouldn't you have to repay this favor?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.400
I understand.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.210
Don't go online these days.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.980
Focus on your filming.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.640
After this blows over,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.900
if you want to rest,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.530
I'll ask the crew for leave.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.159
If necessary, we can go back and stay home.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.960
Stop.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.920
I still need to focus on my filming.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.760
Since we've decided on the cold treatment,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.560
let's pretend it never happened

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.850
and go about our business as usual.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.240
What's wrong, sweetie?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.920
Mom,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.680
I want to go find Dad.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.250
It's so late now.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.920
Let's not disturb

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
your father.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.560
Sleep with Mommy,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.440
okay?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.240
But I already promised Dad.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.040
Dad will be very busy today

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.040
and Mom misses you too.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.159
Mom,

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.920
why don't you sleep with Dad tonight?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.480
Mom is also very busy.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.260
How about this.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.600
You go to Dad tonight.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
Remember to behave.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.680
Don't cause any trouble.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.560
Okay?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.360
Okay.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.080
Good girl.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.720
Let's go.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.850
I'll take you there.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.720
No need.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.200
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.640
What does that mean?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.720
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.400
Slow down.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.160
Sugar daddy. Mistress. Diva behavior.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.280
Revealing photos. Plastic surgery.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.360
It's always the same few words over and over.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.820
Don't they get tired of it?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.720
Ugly freak.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.920
Get out of the entertainment industry.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.080
How original.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.410
Someone actually called me an ugly freak.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.800
All fancy moves done by a stunt double.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.520
Not worthy of playing Shanlan.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.380
The power of money is terrifying.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.840
Which eye of yours saw me using a stunt double?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.370
Do you even prepare before spreading rumors?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.880
Can this industry darling just get out of showbiz?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.840
Where should I go?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.280
To your house perhaps?

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.740
Get lost. You're the one who should get lost.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.640
I have to endure when things are transparent.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.520
I still have to endure when they're not.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.560
Am I a Ninja Turtle or something?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.720
It's nothing.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.780
It's not like I haven't been scolded before.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.400
It's no big deal.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.400
If feeling wronged

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.100
is the necessary path to becoming stronger,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.160
then let the grievances

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.800
come even more fiercely.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.290
Once I get through this,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.480
I'll still be standing strong.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.080
Hello?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.050
Why hasn't he made his move yet?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.760
No, what does he mean?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.650
Come here right now.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.360
I'll call you back later.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.640
Is this what you've been working on

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.570
for three weeks? Your company transformation plan?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.640
Yes.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.000
For a successful transformation,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.680
the only way is to abandon the family business model,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.760
remove those board members who occupy positions

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.600
but don't contribute anything,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.000
integrate existing resources,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.660
and increase investment in the Yiping Sunshine Film subsidiary.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.640
Increase film investment?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.840
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.640
You're doing all this for a woman,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.640
willing to ruin the entire company!

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.720
Yes.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.770
I do like Zheng Ying.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.080
But I would never be someone who damages the company's interests

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.540
to satisfy my own desires.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.530
Director Cheng.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.960
Don't you think

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.250
you're being a bit narrow-minded?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.760
You're right.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.530
After all, I'm not like you.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.040
Shen Yifan.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.720
Are you even a man?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.600
Do you have any idea

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.920
how much your girlfriend is suffering right now?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.040
And you're just standing here doing nothing.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.040
Do you even care about her feelings?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.300
You know very well.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.000
She's my girlfriend.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.040
So you don't want to handle this?

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.920
If you won't, I will.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.600
Mr. Cheng.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.880
This path was never meant to be smooth.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.600
But also.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.890
This is her own journey.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.480
Just like mushrooms need to be watered

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.760
to grow.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.800
She needs to rely on her own strength

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.900
and her own efforts

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.530
to resolve this situation.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.960
Only then can she achieve her own transformation.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.200
No.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.560
Why?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.080
Why should she rely on her own strength?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.200
With your abilities, Shen Yifan,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.040
is it that you can't protect her

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.300
or you don't want to keep protecting her?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.690
But I won't be like that.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.680
If her path is rough, I'll smooth it for her.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.080
I'll smooth it completely, till the very end.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.800
But in this world,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.960
not everything can go as you wish.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.960
Your life,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.060
your promises,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.020
are worthless in the face of time.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.240
Your solemn vows right now

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.480
only prove the present.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.140
The future is unpredictable.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.800
Besides,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.640
Zheng Ying isn't the type of person

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.000
who wants to be protected for her entire life.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.060
Do you understand?

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.840
Hello?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.840
Mr. Cheng,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.810
your father is in emergency care at the hospital.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.970
I'll be right there.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.720
Mr. Shen,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.140
I heard many shareholders of Cheng Group

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.320
have rushed to the hospital.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.240
How many of them

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.500
are actually there to visit the patient?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.900
Cheng Moyang's days ahead

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.200
are going to be tough.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.680
Mr. Shen,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.680
shouldn't we go to the hospital too?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.090
Let's go to the film set.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.200
Mr. Shen,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.600
there's nothing left to do at the film set.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.320
Why don't you go home and rest?

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.040
If she keeps putting up with this,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.240
she wouldn't be Zheng Ying anymore.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.080
But didn't you say

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.280
you wouldn't interfere in her affairs?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.570
I can choose not to do anything.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.360
But I must give her

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.890
the confidence to do whatever she needs to do.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.880
I've got some juicy gossip,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.880
want to hear it?

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.600
It's free.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.610
I doubt there's any gossip juicier than mine.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.240
Your story,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.600
I haven't sold it out.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.460
I actually wish you would sell it.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.320
At least that way,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.240
some people would know the truth.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.200
You think I don't want to?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.520
It's just that Brother Youyi said

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.600
the time isn't right yet.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.460
We have to wait.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.400
Otherwise,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.440
it would be disadvantageous to you.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.240
So,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.120
I'm being considerate, right?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.000
Yes. I knew you were loyal from what happened last time.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.640
Come on,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.100
help me rehearse my lines.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.530
Let me try to grab it.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.320
Like this.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.360
Ni Hao has been clinging to you lately.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.360
Must be causing you a lot of trouble.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.200
Not at all.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.840
He does call me dad after all.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.900
I definitely will.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.000
I just meant that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.960
I really like Ni Hao.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.840
So...

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.560
You go first.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800
A thank-you gift.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.240
Thank you.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.650
I'll go back to work now.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.680
Mr. Shen.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.720
Young master.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.440
Zheng Ying still has two more scenes before she's done.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.120
Why don't

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.320
you rest for a while?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.200
When she comes back,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200
I'll let you know.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.040
Don't run!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680
Stop right there!

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.600
Cut!

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.340
Let's do one more take.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.160
Okay.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.920
Cut!

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.140
Let's do another take.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.760
Okay.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.800
Cut!

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.000
I thought we could wrap up early.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.800
Now look.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.260
This is never going to end.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.640
She's trying to build an image of being dedicated to her job.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.500
So we have to play along, don't we?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.880
This actress has such strong commitment.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.240
After all that criticism,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.840
she can still act like nothing happened.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.560
Yeah.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.200
By the way,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.080
Mr. Cheng has a livestream tonight.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.120
Don't forget to watch it.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.080
Maybe

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080
there will be some big revelations.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.880
If I keep putting up with this,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.240
I won't be Zheng Ying anymore.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.560
Is she back?

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680
I'll go get her.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.280
No need.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.200
Don't tell her I came by.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.000
Alright.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.840
Yes.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.440
I'm wearing a hospital gown

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.700
still in the hospital.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.460
I'm doing this livestream

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.720
to thank everyone for your concern.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.000
The doctor says

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.400
I can be discharged soon.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.440
Please don't worry about me.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.260
Some people are asking

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.840
why I quit the show

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.840
and if there's any inside story.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.520
Well, my health

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.040
isn't in good condition, right?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.160
I can't delay

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.080
the production schedule,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.640
can I?

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.440
So

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.840
I resigned from the role.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.000
Mr. Cheng,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.800
what's your take on internet celebrity actors?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.290
Well, about that...

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.120
As long as they're professional

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.320
and have acting skills,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.520
they're good actors.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.450
As for the others...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.240
I won't say more.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.200
Those who know, know.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200
Stop.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.730
Please stop sending gifts.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.720
Look.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:37.800
This...

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.280
This...

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.600
Where is the button

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.520
to turn off donations?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.840
I really don't

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.370
understand how this works.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.320
Thank you all,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.240
please stop sending gifts.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.700
I appreciate the gesture.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.080
Mr. Cheng.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.320
Could it be that

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.800
there's alcohol in your thermos?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.440
Mr. Cheng.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.240
Are you feeling better?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120
The doctor says

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.400
I'm just overworked

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.240
and need

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.760
some rest for a while.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.440
So it's overwork.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.000
I thought it was

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.160
that smell again.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.000
The first time I met you in the dressing room,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I smelled it.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.760
And during filming too.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.560
What is that smell exactly?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.820
What smell could there be?

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.640
Don't make wild guesses.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.400
I know now.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.560
It's alcohol.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.360
My goodness, Mr. Cheng.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.880
You were drinking while filming too.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.960
And you're still drinking while in hospital.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.240
You really don't take care of yourself.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.440
Don't talk nonsense.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.400
Let me help you.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.800
Isn't this just alcohol?

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.480
You.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.680
You clearly have alcohol dependency.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.280
You can't remember your lines

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.760
yet you blame me for it.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.440
Not only that,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.240
you're stepping on me to boost your own popularity.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.080
Ms. Cheng,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.920
you're quite the role model

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.680
as a senior in the industry.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.480
I step on you

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.880
to gain popularity.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.210
You can do the same to me.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.520
No one cares

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.850
about the truth.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.340
It's mutually beneficial, we each get what we need.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.160
You attention-seekers

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.180
don't even understand

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.770
this basic concept?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.760
I understand,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.490
but I'm not interested.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.520
Maybe my acting skills aren't good enough yet,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.050
but that's only temporary.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.480
I want to climb up

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.480
step by step through my own efforts.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.720
My foundation

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.120
can only be my own ability,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.380
not publicity stunts.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.080
This matter

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.040
ends here.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.480
I hope you,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.280
Ms. Cheng, will take care of yourself.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.010
Stop acting so high and mighty.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.360
Aren't you just backed by capital?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.480
Go back

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.400
and work on your acting skills.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.800
You're not qualified

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.320
to criticize me yet.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.380
I may not have your seniority,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.360
but when it comes to being a decent person,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.520
you fall far short.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.920
Good morning, Youyi.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.050
What makes you think I'm in a good mood?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.850
I need to freshen up.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.240
Why did you go to the hospital last night?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.300
Why did you go looking for Chengdong?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.320
Didn't we agree to let things cool down?

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.650
Why add fuel to the fire?

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.400
Do you have any idea

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.240
how many trending topics you're in right now?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.000
Letting things cool down

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.240
won't reduce the number of trending topics about me.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.640
The outcome is the same either way.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.880
So why should I keep carrying all these false accusations?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.960
Besides, he clearly has no

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.490
intention of backing down.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.880
And I just happened to discover

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.610
that he's likely an alcoholic.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.380
So I decided to test my theory.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600
Test your theory?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.200
What if you're wrong?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.920
Have you thought about how to handle the fallout?

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.280
Fine, let's take a step back.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.640
Even if your judgment is correct,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.560
how can you be sure that reporter who was secretly filming you

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.120
captured the entire process?

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.920
If they didn't capture everything,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.320
do you know what the consequences would be?

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.680
Do you realize what rumors people will spread

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.840
about an actress going to a hospital

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.120
in the middle of the night?

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.720
Have you thought about that?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.440
Do you still want a career in this industry?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.160
They definitely got the footage.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.400
Where's this confidence coming from?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.200
Because

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.800
I hired the reporter myself.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.970
What did you say?

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.720
Mr. Wan,

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.050
do you know any entertainment reporters?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.120
I do.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.280
But what do you need them for?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.280
Buying melons?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.340
Or selling melons?

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.600
Or growing them?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.640
You're playing entrapment here.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.600
No.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.900
You're so impressive.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.770
Does your Mr. Shen know about this?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.800
He'll definitely be proud of me.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.080
After all, Chengdong publicly apologized.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.880
My reputation has been cleared.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.090
You're something else.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.160
No wonder

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.220
you're the woman Shen Yifan fell for.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.380
I'll go take care of it.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.480
Leave it to me.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.000
Take these photos and get them processed.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.760
Thank you for your hard work.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.480
I'm sorry.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.160
Zheng Ying is currently on set.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.640
It's not convenient for an interview right now.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.320
Alright.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.920
We can consider doing a magazine cover.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.100
Brother Youyi.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.460
Zheng Ying is getting even more popular.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.730
You're really amazing.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.200
Be careful with business contacts.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.560
Okay.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.890
Continue with the magazine shoot.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.400
Mr. Shen.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.700
What are you doing?

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.960
If Zheng Ying calls later,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.840
tell her

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.050
that I'm busy right now.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.320
Hello.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.040
This is Wu Yu.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.440
Mr. Shen is very busy now.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.440
He'll get back to you

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440
later.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.640
I see.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.170
I'll wait for his call then.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.600
Take good care of him.
