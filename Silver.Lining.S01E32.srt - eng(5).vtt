WEBVTT

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.520
Director Meng

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.600
Luo Xun

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.680
is dead.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.000
By the time I arrived with my team,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.460
there were no vital signs.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.160
We're certain Chi Xia did it.

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.840
Absolutely.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.280
The security cameras caught her.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.680
She pushed Chi Xiao down.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.610
Where is Chi Xia?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.940
We can't reach her.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.080
Luo Xun.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.680
Remove all surveillance cameras

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.039
in the area that can capture this place.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
Understood?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.320
Yes.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.039
I know about Chi Xiao now.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.400
Where are you?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.160
Can we meet?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.480
Why so gloomy?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.260
Business is business.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.200
No one is above the law.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.720
Curly.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.100
Issue a wanted notice.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.170
Put out an APB on Chi Xia.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.400
Wait.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
On the notice,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.010
don't mention her occupation.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.860
Let her keep some dignity.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.520
Okay.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.400
The rest of you shouldn't be idle either.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.360
Yang Zhiming is right there.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.560
We have to arrest him.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.600
Now we have the evidence.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560
First, send someone to protect Lu Ningzhi.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.890
It's time to bring in this Yang Zhiming

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.810
to cooperate with our investigation.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.440
Hello.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.800
We're from Dongzhou City Police Department.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.920
Routine inspection.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.720
Okay.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.200
This way.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.000
Mr. Yang.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.560
Yang Zhiming, right?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.520
I'm Luo Xun, captain of the Municipal Police Major Crimes Unit.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.480
Please come with us

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.410
to assist with our investigation.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.640
Let's go.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.680
Are you okay?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.320
Still alive.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.280
Do you know

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.240
they've already started

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.440
posting wanted notices for you online?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.240
So what?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.640
Are you a messenger of justice?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.000
Are you here to arrest me for the police?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.800
You know that's not what I meant.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.000
Why did you kill her?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080
What do you think?

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.880
Chi Xia

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.280
Do you know how helpless your parents were

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.560
when they died?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.960
The fire slowly peeled away their skin,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.960
and no matter how loudly they screamed, it was useless.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
And you were far away in Qin City,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.880
just a fresh graduate from the police academy,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.240
unable to do anything.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.520
How disappointed your parents must have been

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.159
in their only daughter.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.450
Because what she said was true.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.440
Because she hit my weak spot.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.000
It's been five years.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.240
My parents' death

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.170
has always been a thorn in my heart.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.980
I've always hated myself.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.980
Hated myself for not being in Dongzhou then.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.840
Hated that I knew something was wrong

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.720
but couldn't figure it out.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.120
Hated that even though I became a police officer,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.920
I still couldn't avenge them or clear their names.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.200
That

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.320
fire.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.420
How desperate my parents must have felt.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.080
When the fire was burning their skin,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.680
how much pain they must have been in.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.880
Before they died,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.080
did they call out my name?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.200
Did they

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.640
regret adopting me?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.760
Because of all this,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.800
I wanted her dead.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.460
Is that so hard to understand?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.840
But it wasn't your fault.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.540
Even if you had been in Dongzhou then,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.140
you couldn't have changed anything.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.840
When Chi Xiao was carrying out the order

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.900
to kill my parents,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.570
did you know about it or not?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.920
I didn't know.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.440
I'm sorry.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.320
But I don't regret it.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.090
I've only let down you and Uncle Fu Gang

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.320
who risked your lives to help me escape from Lawa Village.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.960
If I had known it would be like this,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.820
I might as well have stayed there.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.970
To avoid suffering like I am today.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.800
On one side,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.680
professional ethics.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.480
Moral condemnation.

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.240
On the other side,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.720
the pull of hatred.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.360
The satisfaction of revenge.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.280
I have nowhere to go now,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.520
like a rat everyone wants to kill.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.800
Qu Bai.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.160
You should go.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.890
Don't get dragged down with me.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.740
Those days in the past,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.200
I can't go back.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.400
Yes, you can.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.960
Come in.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.480
Reporting.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.679
Director Chang.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.400
Ah, Luo Xun.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.320
Look.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960
Yang Zhiming has confessed everything clearly.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.880
All suspects have been arrested.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.720
The evidence is extremely solid.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.520
To be honest,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.640
since I joined the Major Crimes Unit,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.700
I've never handled such an easy case.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.360
Good.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.120
Well done.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.640
By the way,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.400
I need to tell you two things.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.720
With the help of Interpol,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.200
we've been able to investigate

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.360
and identify Old K's real identity.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.520
His real name is Huang Weisheng.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.440
He's Chinese.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.840
His parents divorced when he was young,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.440
and he lived with his mother.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.320
In 1984,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.280
his mother was murdered.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.360
Although they caught the killer,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.080
due to insufficient evidence,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.040
no conviction was made.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.320
Later he left the country

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.780
and went to Mengkun State,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.560
where he's been involved in illegal business ever since.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.400
Until today.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.810
There's one more thing.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.560
Fu Gang's

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.770
identity has also been confirmed.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.200
These are the files from the provincial department.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.960
His real name is Liu Gang,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.880
but he doesn't have any family left.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.120
However, he has a handler

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.080
named Zhang Jinguo.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.780
Multiple serious illegal activities, some cases are connected to a recent one.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.040
What's wrong, Qu Bai?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.760
Chi Xia.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.220
An old friend wants to talk to you.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.040
Long time no see,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.880
little fox.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.120
I really don't know if Qu Bai is helping me

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.640
or hurting me.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.760
I think

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.520
we can talk.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.280
I have nothing to say to the mastermind

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.410
who ordered the killing of my parents.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.800
I only hate myself

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.640
for not having the chance to kill you with my own hands.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.480
It's my fault for not finding you sooner,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.240
leaving you

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.500
in this difficult situation now.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.880
Qu Bai says

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.800
revenge makes you feel happy.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.400
That's a happiness you couldn't feel

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.960
when you were a police officer

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.680
catching criminals, right?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.440
Before,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.160
I misjudged.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.680
I only focused on making you all ruthless,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.380
making you heartless.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.120
I forgot that virtue and evil

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.880
can coexist.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.800
Chi Xia,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.400
don't hide your desires.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.600
Deep down,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.920
you crave crime.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.480
We are the same kind.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.360
You didn't make this call

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.320
just to lecture me, did you?

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.240
Of course not.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.920
I just want to make a small deal with you.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.240
You're so smart,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.240
you must be able to guess.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.400
Since it's a deal,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.480
what can you offer me?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.960
Freedom,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.240
money.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.340
If you're willing,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.080
you can come back to my side.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.040
Whatever I have,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.360
you will have too.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.000
And I

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.800
only want one array.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.960
Impossible.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.680
What if you go back on your word after getting the array?

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.880
Isn't this kind of betrayal

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.680
something people like you do all the time?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.040
What do you want then?

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.170
Resource exchange.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.490
I want the master password key.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.040
Little fox,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.560
I'm afraid

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.530
you're not in a position to negotiate with me.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.420
Then there's nothing to discuss.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.210
What if I told you

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.890
I have something

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.040
that will force you to cooperate with me?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.700
Do you still remember him?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.440
Your dear uncle.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.760
This is Mr. Zhang's study.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280
Do you mind if I...

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.900
Since Mr. Zhang passed away early last year,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.820
nothing has been touched.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.440
I just come by occasionally

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.640
to dust the place.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.210
Before Comrade Zhang Jinguo passed away,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.720
did he leave any message?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.120
His death was sudden.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.660
He didn't leave anything.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.580
He did have a habit of keeping a diary though.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.480
Here.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.140
Nothing much has changed, right?

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.600
Yes.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.540
It's been 15 years.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.520
I'm back again.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.240
I'm sorry.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.220
I didn't know Fu Gang was still alive.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600
Even if you knew,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.200
what could you have changed?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.080
You are Chi Xia.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.890
Please hand over all electronic devices.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.440
Welcome home,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.320
little fox.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.160
This place is still the same as before,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.120
lifeless.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.730
When you ran away back then,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840
did you ever think

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.200
that one day you would come back?

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.960
Actually,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.240
I've always had a feeling

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.600
that

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.760
we would meet again.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.200
I've heard foxes

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.160
like to make their dens in graves.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.920
So,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.760
isn't the lifeless Lawa Village

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.800
perfect for you,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.600
little fox?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.080
I'm not your little fox.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.640
Chi Xiao was,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.970
even though she's dead now.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.800
I killed her.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.570
Still that stubborn attitude.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.360
Chi Xiao,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.920
she was proud

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.640
and not steady enough.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.760
Compared to her,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.370
I actually admire you more.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.360
Don't say these useless things.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.010
Since I'm willing to come back,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.480
I'm naturally willing to join you

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.810
in your dirty business.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.920
But what I want,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.180
you know very well.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.040
Where is he?

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.480
You've tortured him like this.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.839
Uncle.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.480
Uncle.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.760
Uncle.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.080
Uncle, I'm Xiaxia.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.080
I'm Xiaxia.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.960
Chi Xia.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.280
Chi Xia.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.600
What happened to you?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.920
I never gave up on him.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.720
I've been trying to cure him.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.120
You want to cure him,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.680
just to get the array from him.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.620
That's not fair to say.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.500
After all these years,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.770
without any backup,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.160
I've done pretty well for myself.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.760
I could have easily killed him,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.560
couldn't I?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.720
Don't be so tense.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.480
Since I've brought him to you,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.370
I won't do anything more to him.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.380
Actually, I quite admire him.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.210
His faith is strong,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.980
his position unwavering.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.680
No matter how I tortured him,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.560
I couldn't make him talk.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.620
You've met the person.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.080
What about the array?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.480
Can you tell me now?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.400
No.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.440
Fu Gang must return to China.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.930
I need you to guarantee his safety.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.810
Take him to Dongzhou City Police Station.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.930
Then I'll tell you about the array.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.800
Otherwise,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.360
no deal.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.480
To prevent you from taking him somewhere

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.080
and quietly disposing of him.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.320
I want a video call.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.560
I need to see him return to the country with my own eyes.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.960
Standing safely at the entrance of Dongzhou Police Station.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.130
What I promised you,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360
I've done it all.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.120
So where's my array?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.220
Listen carefully.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.060
The sequence is...

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.280
You suspect there's something fishy about Chi Xia being wanted by the police?

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.400
Even if this falls into the hands of the police,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.600
what good would it do?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.720
The password

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.800
only I have it.
