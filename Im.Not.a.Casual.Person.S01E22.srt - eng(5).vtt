00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.300
So according to Mrs. Shen's plan,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.840
what should we do next?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.009
What's this?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.200
Since we're short on time,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.660
we need to speed things up.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440
You'll just have to make do for now.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.680
Quick, call me Dad.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.640
Dad.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.520
Good boy.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.900
Where are we going?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.720
It's our son's parent-teacher conference today.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.920
You didn't even know?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
This is a middle school conference?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800
We can't waste time.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.130
Hurry up.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.380
Our son is waiting.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.970
With so many children here,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.490
which one is our son?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.160
Usually his mother comes. I never had the time.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.360
Yes.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.400
That's him.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400
How could you not recognize your own son?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.200
Go now.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.180
It's been over 10 minutes.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.340
Why aren't you coming out yet?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.160
Why are you so slow?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.960
I was just talking with that teacher

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.090
about a math problem for quite a while.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.240
What's wrong?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.900
My belly...

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.960
Hurry!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.440
Honey,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.600
I'm going into labor with our second child!

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.400
Second child?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.360
Let's go!

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.000
Let's go!

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.010
Have some fruit.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.079
At 40,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.720
we're a happy family of four.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.880
You're both 45 now.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.380
Are you still this sweet with each other?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.580
Let's have a third child tonight.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.920
At 55, our son has graduated.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.400
Good.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.120
At 60,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.500
all our children are married.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.040
At 70,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.880
our grandson...

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.280
what was his name again?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.320
Have you been waiting long?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.400
Time flies so fast.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.240
It feels like only a day has passed.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.920
Yet it also feels like a lifetime.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.880
Get into character.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.000
We're eighty years old now.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600
If I could really see you at eighty,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.280
that would be wonderful.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.560
I'm old now.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.200
Am I ugly?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.300
Your skin is wrinkled.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.090
Your eyes have lost their sparkle.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.720
Your lips are sunken.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.640
And when you walk,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.100
you're slower now.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.280
What?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.060
Are you disgusted with me?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.800
I love you.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.180
Is this the life you imagined?

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.800
What's wrong?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.280
Is it different from what you imagined?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.420
According to my imagination,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.200
in the future,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.400
you'll become an incredible actress.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.320
From home to abroad,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.250
winning countless awards.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.300
You'll spend your brilliant life

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.090
in the career you love most.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.820
That's not a conflict.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.050
I can become an incredible actress

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.360
and still spend my life with you.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.360
Today,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.450
do you have any regrets?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.560
We're in such a rush today.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.080
There's so much I still want to do.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.560
Look,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.200
we haven't given our child

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.480
a beautiful name yet.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.480
We haven't taken a trip together either.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.280
That's right.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440
We never made it to that revolving restaurant we talked about.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.320
And we

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.120
still need to visit your hometown,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.450
to see where you grew up.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.360
You haven't met my grandmother yet, have you?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.080
My grandmother gives very generous New Year money.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.560
And my hometown

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.200
is so lively during New Year's.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.080
When we go,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.680
the whole family will surround you

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.200
and take turns complimenting you.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.460
We should also go to...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.780
Shen Yifan?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.880
Shen Yifan!

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.560
You scared me to death!

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.290
We're both over eighty now.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.180
For people our age,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.360
passing away mid-conversation

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800
is actually quite likely to happen.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.410
Don't you dare leave me behind.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.640
Alright.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.200
Actually,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.880
in this life,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.560
being with you

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.360
has already been worth everything.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.120
Me too.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.620
I should go now.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.240
Do you want me to accompany you to Switzerland?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.540
Do you remember

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.410
when you said

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.640
that we

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.500
are more like comrades-in-arms?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.640
Your career,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.240
your dreams,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.559
are what we've been working toward together.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.799
I don't want you

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.799
to give up

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.880
those important plans in your life because of me.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.559
Promise me

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.700
you'll keep going.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.610
You also need to do it for yourself.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.800
Don't give up.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.490
Don't worry.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.560
Are we just leaving like this?

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.360
Aren't you going to see them off?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
What's the point?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.500
It's not like he's never coming back.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.880
Mr. Shen,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.360
we'll definitely be back.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.080
How many times have I told you?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.560
Why won't you change?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560
Get away from me.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.680
Don't interfere in my business.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.320
Are you going to listen to me or not?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.640
I won't listen to you.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.770
Are you still the mother of this child?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.930
Give it to me!

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.560
Let go!

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.160
Give it to me!

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.320
Let go!

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.400
Mom, don't leave!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.440
Moyang.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.040
You.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.200
If you want to leave, go ahead.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.400
But my son stays here.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.760
You.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.440
Mom, Mom, don't go!

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.680
Mom.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.040
Be good.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.050
This is excellent wine.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.090
Are you really sure about this?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.460
Once you leave,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.240
there's no turning back.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.360
Turning back?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.480
I never thought about turning back.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.880
So what if I'm expelled from the Three Halls?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.080
Fighting for justice

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.480
is what I, Shanlan, was born to do.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.960
I believe the day we reunite with our junior sister

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.000
will come soon.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.210
Alright, that's a wrap.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.450
Come on, let's prepare for the next scene.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.980
Old classmate.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.930
Your artist is really impressive.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.240
Just went through that trending topic controversy.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.640
Yet her acting condition is so well-adjusted.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.040
Completely unaffected.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.000
Well, you should consider

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.200
which manager is handling this artist.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.000
Enough.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.240
If your artist is doing this well,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640
how are you doing?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.720
What's wrong with me?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.580
I'm doing fine.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.600
Looking at all this equipment,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.330
doesn't it make you feel itchy?

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.240
Come on.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.480
I have things to do.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.210
I'm leaving.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.080
What you need to face

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.080
you'll have to face sooner or later.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.260
Let me tell you,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.400
you must follow my lead tonight.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.000
You shoot whatever I tell you to shoot, got it?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.840
Come on,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.400
the cinematographer said

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.760
we'll just casually shoot some footage today,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.360
just establishing shots of the night scene.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.090
Just shoot whatever, you know?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.600
No,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.760
how can we be casual about photography?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760
Just listen to me,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.760
let's go over there.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.360
Fine.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.200
Dad, I'm here!

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.120
Dad, teach me how to take photos!

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.410
I don't touch machines.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.880
Dad, aren't you touching it right now?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.360
Teach me how to take photos!

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.010
Alright.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.000
Let's go.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.780
Come on.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.000
Haven't I told you many times?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.600
I don't want to see you again.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.840
Don't think that by doing this,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.900
I will forgive you.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.480
Ma'am,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240
I'll be going now.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.120
Don't forget

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.980
there are 20 more boxes tomorrow.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.320
How is it?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.760
This is way too shabby.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.360
What,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680
are you suggesting that we're stuck

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.010
in this tiny editing room forever?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.520
068,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.010
prosperity all the way.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.520
Baby.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.610
Do you remember everything Mom just told you?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.120
Yes, I do.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.360
Good girl.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:50.880
Mom,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.760
why did you ask me to learn photography from Dad

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.560
and now you're here again?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.120
What's really going on?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.890
To save someone.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.160
Are you willing to help?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.120
Yes,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.120
I want to save Dad.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.460
That's my girl.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.210
Let's go.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.330
It's so late.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.690
Why are you all here?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.280
We're here to rescue someone.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.050
I don't have anyone.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.250
Do you want to go in and check together?

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.970
Ni Hao is asleep.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.810
She won't wake up anytime soon.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.520
Thank you for today.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.480
It's nothing.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.880
What's your plan now?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.600
To reclaim the career

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600
that I've lost.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.130
That's good.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.160
And to win back

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.620
the person I let slip away.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.560
Ni Shang.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.640
Let's start over.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.440
Mom, where are you?

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.120
Ni.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.760
Ni Hao is awake.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.880
I'll go check on her.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.880
You don't need to answer me right away.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.410
I'm ready whenever you are.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.840
Okay.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.020
Just got off the plane?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.840
Yeah.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.460
What about you?

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.420
I just got back.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.120
Good morning, my boyfriend.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.840
No, wait.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.640
To the outside world,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.170
we're not a couple anymore.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.280
So what should I call you?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.960
Ex-boyfriend?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.560
A few days ago you were still Mrs. Shen.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.600
Just a few days apart,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.360
and suddenly you're my ex-wife.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.160
Impressive.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.800
What's on your schedule today?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.360
How did his artificial heart surgery go?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.400
Well,

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.680
the artificial heart

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.080
is a pump device assisting his left ventricle,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.520
helping the heart pump blood

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.040
to extend his time.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.960
Next is waiting for a matching heart donor

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.040
for a heart transplant.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.880
I saw a term today

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.410
called Pareto optimality.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.880
I certainly know what it means.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.960
Ms. Zheng Ying,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.420
it's your turn to perform.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.940
Coming right away.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400
Just like us.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.640
After we got together,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.760
neither of us was hurt

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.600
and we both became better people.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.960
That's the result of Pareto improvement.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.600
Right?

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.120
Among all the roles you've played in your films,

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.650
which one is your favorite?

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.920
The next one.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.330
How are you feeling?

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.280
The patient has post-operative complications.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.600
Help! Help!

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.120
The patient's condition isn't looking good.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.120
Call everyone for a meeting. Hurry!

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.360
Mr. Cheng.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.320
When did this happen?

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.250
Half an hour ago.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.520
Chairman Cheng's condition has started to deteriorate.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.920
What should we do?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.760
Mr. Cheng.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.700
We've followed you for so many years.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.890
Immediately publish an obituary on the intranet under my name.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.760
Don't let this information leak outside.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.220
Gather all shareholders.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.690
Call a board meeting immediately.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.520
Also contact Chairman Cheng's personal lawyer.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.120
Check his will.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.640
See how many women he's made provisions for.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.280
Go.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.600
Okay.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.600
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.680
from today onwards,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.800
I will officially take over

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.130
as the chairman of Yiping Sunshine Group.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.880
Moyang,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.720
there are some things

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.220
I never wanted you to know.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.420
Your mother was an alcoholic.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.520
I tried to help her quit drinking,

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.600
but it was of no use.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.880
I kept this from you

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.160
to preserve the image of your mother in your heart.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:20.920
However,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.320
How many times have I told you?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320
Why don't you change?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.800
Why don't you quit drinking?

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.520
Why can't I drink?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.080
And you?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.080
Why should I let you control me?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.720
Go die with Mom.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.640
What are you doing?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.520
Are you crazy?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.440
I don't want to live anymore.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.840
Let go!

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.400
Let

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.040
go of me!

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.120
I'm taking my son with me.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.880
No way.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.440
Until you successfully quit drinking,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.360
my son can't go with you.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.320
Mom! Don't go!

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.280
Moyang.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.280
Moyang.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.800
You.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.520
If you want to leave, go ahead,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.720
but my son stays here.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.370
Have you ever thought about

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.850
what kind of person you want to become?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.140
Definitely not a man like you.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.880
I'm sorry.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.760
I just heard about

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.320
your uncle's passing.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.840
Are you okay?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.520
I'm such a jerk.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.980
If I had found that letter a few days earlier,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.410
it would have made all the difference.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.280
