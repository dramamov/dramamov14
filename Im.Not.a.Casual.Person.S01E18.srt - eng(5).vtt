WEBVTT

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.759
Thank you for saving me today, General.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.400
I am deeply grateful.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.840
But I have no way to repay you.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.800
Between husband and wife,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.060
there's no need to talk about repayment.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.320
I don't understand what you're saying, General.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.580
You don't understand?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.200
I think you understand perfectly well.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.120
My

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.800
General's wife.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.440
You jest, General.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.260
Perhaps we'll meet again.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120
Who would have thought that the feared Red Lady Bandit

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.720
could be so innocent.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.400
Interesting.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.540
Very interesting.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.440
Stop. That's good. We got it.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.640
Everyone's in good form today.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.400
Especially Zheng Ying.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.260
She nailed every take in one shot.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600
At this rate, we'll wrap up early today.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.560
No wonder.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.980
So she's in a hurry to finish work.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.100
There must be something behind this unusual behavior.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.680
Who else but Mr. Shen

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.610
could make her act so differently?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.400
The weather hasn't been good lately.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.260
Drink this to soothe your throat.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.090
I'm going to touch up my makeup.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.400
Film crew gossip!

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.760
Agent and award-winning actress,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.200
investor and starlet.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.360
Guaranteed juicy gossip,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160
200 per story, non-negotiable.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.760
DM if interested.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.000
Mom,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.280
kindergarten is having a parent-child event next week.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.840
Can you come?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.560
Sweetie.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.880
But Mommy will be on set next week.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.120
I probably can't get away.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.280
I knew it.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.600
Good thing I already asked Dad,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.760
and he promised he would come.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.560
Thank you.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.200
Nihao told me yesterday

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.530
that you agreed to go with him to the parent-child event.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.360
Yes.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.800
I was worried you wouldn't have time and couldn't get away,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.000
so I agreed to go.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.680
Actually, you could tell the teacher you're his uncle

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.000
or something like that.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.680
It's fine.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.840
I think being a dad is pretty nice too.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440
No.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.080
What I mean is,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.400
I've got nothing else to do anyway.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.330
Taking a photo with Zhengying!

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.600
I'm so happy we can work together.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.320
But you completely outshine Zhengying.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.650
I can't believe someone who looks like her

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.440
can act. You're much prettier than her.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.880
Your acting is better too.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.200
Sis, we're all set.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.920
Thanks.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.850
You're welcome.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.120
Xiaoying.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.320
We really like you.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.850
Can we take a photo with you?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.320
I'm sorry. I have something to do.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.250
Maybe tomorrow.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.120
What an attitude!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.560
That's enough.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
Your boyfriend already knows

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.840
what you look like.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.680
How is that enough?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.320
I've been staying up late these days.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.160
No matter how I do my makeup, I can't restore my original look.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.090
It wasn't that great to begin with.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.920
What are you up to now?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.960
Just got popular but acting like a big shot.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.120
Bury her.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.520
I'm in this production team,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.160
I can testify that actress Z

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.560
is arrogant to extras

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.620
and refuses to take photos with them.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.760
She's not even that pretty.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.400
What right does she have to look down on extras?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.960
How did she get famous?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360
The power of capital.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.840
Wait.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.000
Am I really that famous?

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.800
I've barely made a splash.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.260
Do I really attract this much attention?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.240
Fame brings gossip.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.080
And some people just naturally attract haters.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.010
You've had this quality even before you were famous.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.760
Just stay calm.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Enjoy your date

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.330
and leave the rest to me.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.440
No.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.220
What are you doing?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.680
I heard the sound of someone taking photos.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.840
[Paparazzi]

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.680
Mr. Shen.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.010
I just saw someone taking secret photos outside.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.920
There are always

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.960
entertainment reporters lurking around the set.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.760
They might not be targeting her.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.560
Actually, being photographed isn't a big deal.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560
It could generate some buzz for Zheng Ying.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.680
Just like before.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.080
Hyping up gossip

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.080
will only drag her down further.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.560
What she needs now

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.820
is to take each step steadily and firmly.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.440
Only then can she stand on solid ground.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.720
Are you leaving soon?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.200
Yes, I have a meeting out of town tomorrow.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.720
What about the snacks I prepared for you?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.880
Did you eat them?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.680
Yes, I did.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.640
Have you been going to bed and getting up early?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.900
Are you getting at least 6 hours of sleep?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.720
Yes.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.040
Have you been taking your medicine on time?

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.800
Yes.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.040
Well...

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.320
Are you feeling uncomfortable here?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.280
No.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.080
Trust me.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.610
I'll always be like this in the future,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.780
looking after you.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.760
Actually,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.200
I can look after you too.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.520
I'm serious.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.640
I know.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.080
I want to become a brilliant person like you,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.640
and then take care of you.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.560
I believe in you.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.360
Really?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.480
Really.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.280
Because

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.260
you're Zheng Ying.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.840
Wu Yu,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.100
turn on the heater.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680
I'm fine.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.680
Of course you're fine.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.360
I'm your little lucky star,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840
and the boyfriend of a lucky star

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.370
will naturally be blessed with good fortune.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.000
So...

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.880
How about taking your lucky star back to the hotel first?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.440
No,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.680
I want to take you to the airport.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.480
No refusing,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.680
no lecturing me,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.280
I insist on taking you there.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.080
This way,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.320
I can spend a little more time with you.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.880
I'm worried about you going back alone.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.080
Alright,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.080
Yu Youyi is already on his way to pick me up.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.520
Then...

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.560
you take me first.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.320
What's wrong?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.360
Okay, I got it.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.080
What happened?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.120
Wu Yu says there's air traffic control at the airport.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120
The flight will be delayed.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.450
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.480
No way! Why wait?

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.440
You and Wu Yu

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.560
should both come back to the hotel with me.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.280
Nothing's more important than getting some sleep.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.240
Just follow my plan.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.160
Tonight,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.480
we'll stay at the hotel first,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.080
and leave tomorrow morning.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.040
Hello?

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600
Youyi,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.370
you don't need to pick me up.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.820
Shen Yifan will take me back to the hotel.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.200
Hello?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.160
Is this the hotel reception?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.560
Please book a room for me.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.480
Hello?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.320
We're not going back today.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.380
Going to the hotel.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.370
Following the plan.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.840
Let's go.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.370
Let's go.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.000
You take

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.360
the room in front.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.720
He's

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.340
sharing a room with me.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.640
Mr. Shen.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.200
Do you have to listen to her?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.560
He won't let me.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
He's mine tonight.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.960
You...

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.200
Get lost.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.000
This...

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.000
Mr. Shen, you need to fight back!

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.520
I was just passing by.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.160
I didn't come specifically to see you off.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.320
But since I'm here, I wish you success

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.960
and a safe journey.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.000
Most importantly,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.960
come back safely.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.620
Your emotions seem a bit lacking.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.700
Do you need someone to play off of?

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.160
After all, someone did praise my acting skills.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.280
So this scene

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.760
is about Shanlan seeing Mingjing off,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.280
right?

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.000
Alright, let's do it.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.720
I...

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.120
Farewell.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.160
What about the

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.640
gift?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.760
Do I

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.040
really need to bring a gift?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.800
Then what gift do you want?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.440
You know very well

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.160
what gift I want.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.140
I don't think this part

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.880
is in the script.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.800
Actors can improvise

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.480
based on the atmosphere.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.120
Didn't you know that?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.280
Time to sleep.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.080
Good night.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.040
Good night.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.720
I'll go first.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.080
The shooting is tough.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.340
Take care of yourself.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.240
Zheng Ying.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.200
You need to be strong.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.880
You're supposed to look after that man.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.100
Keep working hard.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.020
I really want to take a photo with her.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.440
But I don't dare.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.480
I'm ready to go.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.180
Do you want to go take a photo with her?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.660
I'm afraid they'll come over.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.800
So what if they do?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.300
You can refuse.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.520
Last time I refused because I was busy

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.120
and got criticized all over social media.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.160
They dug up ancient history

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.440
from my past.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.540
Do you think I still have the right to refuse?

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.820
Do you really care about those comments?

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.760
Shouldn't normal people care?

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.700
When you're on the first floor

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.080
and someone insults you,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.560
you hear it and get angry.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.680
When you're on the tenth floor,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.960
you might think they're just greeting you

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.360
because you can't hear them insulting you.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.040
When you're on the hundredth floor and someone insults you,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.040
you can neither hear nor see them.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.720
People suffer

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.120
because they lack perspective.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.560
Without enough elevation,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.480
all you see are trivial matters.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.480
Rather than wasting energy on those comments,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.600
you should think about

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.130
how to climb to the hundredth floor yourself.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.600
Indeed.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.760
Making yourself stronger is the real solution.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.840
Sister Nishang, I'm such a fan!

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.440
Can we take a photo together?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.680
I'm sorry, work comes first.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.880
I need to go shoot now.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.840
Lesson learned.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.400
Well, Mr. Nihao.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.240
Our kindergarten

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.120
holds a talent show every semester.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.600
This time the theme is photography.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.400
Photography?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.440
I understand you and his mother must be very busy,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.640
but this time

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.160
it's Nihao's last chance

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.400
to participate before graduating.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.040
I really hope you can attend.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040
Please don't leave your child

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.100
with regrets that can never be fixed.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.600
I'm sorry, sir.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.930
We really can't participate anymore.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.840
You'll be in a scene with Senior Cheng soon.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.720
Yes.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.440
I heard this senior actor is very strict.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.130
I'm so nervous I can't even remember my lines.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.000
Actually,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.240
it doesn't matter if you forget.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.329
What do you mean?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.520
There's a rumor.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.720
50. Non-negotiable.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.240
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.720
The rumors seem quite credible.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.360
But I can't guarantee it's true.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.640
I need to wait and see.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.760
Anyway, better be extremely careful.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.600
Lord Niu.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.760
Today

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.920
is the day you die.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.600
Cut!

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.800
Come on, let's do another take quickly.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.280
You came in too early, you know?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.760
I need to stand firm and give you a look,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.800
then you hand it over.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.600
You know what?

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.760
You've

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.620
completely thrown off my rhythm.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.000
You clearly didn't remember your lines.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.920
Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.160
Alright, let's go.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.890
Let's go back and try again.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.320
Three, two, one, action!

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.040
Such arrogance.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.060
Guards!

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.520
Get them!

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520
What is this?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.160
When?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.360
Stop!

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.960
Adjust it quickly.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.850
You're blocking my shot. Do you know that?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.600
How can you be so young

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.360
and so careless?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.000
Quickly, get up.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.660
Get up. Let's do another take.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.920
Come on, get ready.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.200
3, 2, 1, action!

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.360
You.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.200
Stop.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.440
Mr. Cheng,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.640
are you feeling unwell?

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.060
What's wrong with you?

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.660
Do you even know how to act?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.170
Can't you even follow basic blocking?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.920
Someone's secretly filming from the tree.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.880
Stop filming! Stop it now!

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.970
What's going on?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.200
Not all elders deserve respect.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.060
Since he has the advantage of seniority,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.540
you can only endure it.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520
Just be yourself.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.100
Everyone is watching.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.040
He must be busy too.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.480
I'd better review my script.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.120
He finds fault even when there isn't any.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.600
If I actually make a mistake,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.130
he'll completely explode.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.080
Wait, why are you here?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.010
Selling melons?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.920
That's really not necessary.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.640
I've already experienced it firsthand.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.480
No,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.040
I'm here to buy melons.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.840
Actress Z

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.320
never memorizes her lines,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.480
veteran actors suffer tremendously,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.320
and get caught in the crossfire.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.720
What made this go viral

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.880
was a video from the paparazzi.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.440
But it was edited,

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.970
showing only Cheng Dong scolding Zheng Ying.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.720
Just now,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.130
Chengdong's agent posted another Weibo.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320
No text,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.840
just one picture.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.760
It's a bitter gourd.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.200
Zhengying's trending topic has now been pushed

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.720
to third place.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.920
Didn't the paparazzi catch them?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.960
Wasn't the video deleted?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.160
How did it get leaked?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.760
I bet it's Chengdong's agent behind this.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.440
They just want to save face.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.840
But most importantly, they want to ride the publicity wave.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.240
With his current physical condition,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.370
it's unlikely he can take on any roles.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.320
Amateur tricks.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.600
Pulling this stunt right under my nose.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.280
You're clearly overestimating yourself.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.000
Contact the PR department immediately.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.680
What about

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.200
Shen Yifan's side? Any moves from them?

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.000
No movement.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.450
No movement.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.250
Aren't we going to help her?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.480
The position she's in now,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.840
the old rules no longer apply.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.320
It's like the Basel dilemma.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.120
Once you lose the protection of rules,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.780
people will do anything to get a piece of the pie.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.620
If she wants to go further,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.490
she must learn to protect what's hers.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.560
But

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.400
can she handle it?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.530
What are you talking about?

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.280
She's Zheng Ying, after all.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.370
Stop overthinking.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.840
Quickly contact your person to fix this.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.800
If you wait any longer,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.880
you'll be trending all over social media.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.840
Contact him, and then?

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.040
Put pressure on him.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Make Chengdong come forward to clarify.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.730
If all else fails, replace him.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.640
But that won't really solve the problem.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.640
Everyone will just think we're covering up the truth.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.800
Acting skills and character

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.640
don't always go hand in hand.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.160
He's using you to save face.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.020
Building what?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.560
A dedicated professional image.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.800
He's really calculated this well.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.400
For the first time, I feel

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.160
being famous

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.600
can also be a mistake.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.280
I, Shan Lan, assassinate corrupt officials.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.760
I seek not fame,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.440
but to carry out justice on heaven's behalf.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.300
To uphold the justice in my heart.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.120
What does that mean?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.160
It's my favorite line.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.680
Are you

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.320
going to confront him head-on?

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.400
Why not?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.080
I am Zheng Ying after all.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.640
Mr. Niu,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.170
you abduct innocent women,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.720
withhold soldiers' pay,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.240
frame loyal officials, and betray our country for your own glory.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.240
A thousand deaths would not be enough for your crimes.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.080
You've already killed eight officials

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.440
and there's a bounty on your head.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.800
You can't escape.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.320
Why not

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.000
join me instead?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.080
I can certainly protect you

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.010
and you'll enjoy wealth and glory.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.840
I've been prepared to die for a long time,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.370
so why speak of protection?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.120
Enemies surround us, people are starving,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.920
the world is so miserable.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.040
Mr. Niu,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.840
why don't you go to hell

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.680
and enjoy all that glory

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.560
with your like-minded friends?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.960
Stop.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.160
Cut.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.520
Good. Very good.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.640
Ms. Zheng, let me take that.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.480
Excellent! That was amazing!

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.640
Good.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.840
Thank you.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.800
That scene was really good.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.160
Thank you.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.360
Good work, Ms. Zheng.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.770
The training results are good.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.240
Mr. Cheng.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.480
Mr. Cheng.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.080
Mr. Cheng, are you okay?

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.800
Mr. Cheng.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.400
I understand.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.400
Gather the PR department

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.400
for a meeting.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.440
You've already done a great job.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.240
From now on,

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.760
leave it to me.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.360
Is it a lot of trouble?

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.250
Anything related to you

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.600
is never a burden.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.170
Do you remember what I said that night?

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.480
Since I want to become

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.360
someone who shines like you,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.800
then this time,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.720
I must get through it myself.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.100
As for you, you don't need to do anything.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.120
Just wait and see how I handle it.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.640
Just watch me.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.440
I believe you can definitely

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.340
become someone who shines brightly.
