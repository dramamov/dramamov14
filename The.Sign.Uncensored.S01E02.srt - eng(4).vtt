We’d be training non-stop.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.080
- Got it?
- Hooya!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.480
We’re missing one person.

Who’s this girl you’re drawing? She looks so much like Tharn.

Wansarut?

Why is it similar to Tharn’s name?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.920
Is your name Wansa?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.400
Yeah.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.680
Is that a corpse?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.440
About Lieut Tam case, what are you going to do next?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.680

I’m going to keep it confidential first.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.480
Please give me the file.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.680
Yes, Captain.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.360
Tharn, take Yai to back to our dorm first.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.960
I have to find out about something.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.480
Where are you going?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.840
What are you doing here?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.840
What about Yai?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040
He already passed out.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.560
Are you curious about Lieut Tam case?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.680
So am I.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.320
Fine, you keep watch then.

[Door unlocking sound]

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.600
Why are you getting so close?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.640
I can’t see it.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
Why didn’t you find a better place, somewhere with more space?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.800
Shh! Do you want Captain to find out and sack us out of the camp?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.040
The cause of death is drowning because there were trace of water found in the lungs.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.720
He probably died from suffocation because of the water in his lungs.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.480
High possibility of suicide.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760
But Captain Akk thought he was silenced.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.680
So, Captain Akk definitely knows what operation Lieut Tam was doing.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360
But in this case file, it says that…

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.720
there are bruises around his body, arms, and legs. There’s a mark that looks like he was hit by a solid object too.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.400
But it doesn’t say what the actual cause is.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.400
If Lieut Tam was killed…

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.600
why did the culprit dump his body around our camp?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.880
Wasn’t that too risky?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.720
It might be a warning…

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.520
to let us know that they knew about Lieut Tam’s real identity, that he disguised himself as a drug dealer.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.159
Yeah.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.760
What did you find?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.720
I think this knot on his ankles…

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960
Lieut Tam didn’t tie it by himself.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.280
How do you know?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.040
I just know.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.280
Tell me.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.280
[Sound of door opening]

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.360
Where are you going? Come back here.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.640
I’m sleepy. Go back to your bed.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.400
No, I’m not leaving…

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.080
until you’d tell me.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.640
Then sleep here tonight.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.960
I happen to be in need of a bolster.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.760
Let me go.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.679
Let me go.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.760
Let me go.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.559
Sleep here.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.720
The instructor is coming!

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.560
Are you going to be my bolster?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.960
Just get your sleep.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.560
Where are you going, bolster?

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.760
Sleep!

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.560
(Whistle sound)

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.280
Hooya!

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.640
Go!

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.400
Tharn.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.320
I dreamt that you and Phaya were cuddling on his bed.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.920
As if you guys were doing something intimacy.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.120
It was just a dream.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.080
Cut it out and get ready for the class.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.800
Fine, fine.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.600
Sit down.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.600
Open your book and turn to page 24.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.360
Section 4: Criminal Liability.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.120
Let’s see the definition of deliberated or intentional act or behaviour.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.160
It’s the act or behaviour committed intentionally while being well aware of such act or behaviour.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.800
If such act or behaviour is committed by negligence, it is not considered as deliberated act or behaviour.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.360
Left, left, left, left…

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.720
- 8, 9, 10.
- Together.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.680
That kick was really awesome.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.880
I almost couldn’t get back up.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.760
Tharn.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.120
Water.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.160
Thanks.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
No problem.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.080
Hey.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.360
You guys are getting better.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.800
Let’s hear it for yourself.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.040
- Thank you, sir. / - Thank you.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.160
Keep trying

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.040
I’m sorry about earlier, sir.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.880
It’s all right. You did good.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.880
Geez, I thought we’d be able to relax a bit after that hellish week of training.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.240
Nothing has come into my head since the morning class.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.680
Holding a gun and hunting down criminals is enough for a police officer.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.080
Can we talk?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.640
What do you want?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.440
Don’t you want to find out more about Lieut Tam case? About that knot?

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.520
Sit down.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.320
Sit.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.240
- I’m leaving.
- Sit down, Tharn.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.360
Sit.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.640
Sit still.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.720
Put your legs together.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.880
What are you doing?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.280
Just stay still and watch. Don’t you want to know the truth?

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.480
If Lieut Tam really wanted to kill himself, he’d have tied a knot like this.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.160
But look.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.080
This is the photo I took from the case file.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.840
The knot tied by yourself and by the other will look completely different.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.640
If Lieut Tam committed suicide, the knot must be at the front.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.560
But in this photo, the knot is at the back.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.960
This means someone else must tie it for him.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.160
Exactly.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.880
Let’s tell Captain Akk about this.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.360
We still don’t have enough evidence.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.880
Didn’t you hear what Captain said? The authority ordered him to have this case closed.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.720
This means the one behind Lieut Tam’s death must be very powerful.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.560
We must gather more evidence.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.520
But if we need more evidence, will just the two of us capable enough?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.360
It’s five of us.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.040
Spill everything out right now.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.840
Did you know Lieut Tam before coming to this camp?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.960
He was my senior at the university.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.800
When I heard that he killed himself because of the gambling debt, I didn’t believe a single word of it.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.600
Before Lieut Tam joined the special investigation team,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.680
he was one of the best in arresting the criminal gangs for operating online gambling and drug trafficking.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.240
And from what I heard from other instructors,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.800
on the night before his death, he was seen around his lodging.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.880
But he didn’t report himself at the camp.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.720
Khem, are you investigating about this case too?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.720
Thongthai and I sneaked out to

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.240
The door was locked. There was lots of dust on the lock too.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.920
If Lieut Tam was really seen around there that night, he should be back in his lodging, shouldn’t he?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.160
What if it wasn’t Lieut Tam who was at the lodging?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.600
It was probably someone who tried to fabricate the false evidence.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.240
Then we have to start from finding out who that person is.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.400
But it’s not easy at all.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.079
How are we going to find some time to investigate on this?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.119
We barely have enough time to rest with all those trainings and classes.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.960
Also,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.560
If Captain Akk finds out, we’d probably get sacked.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.320
I’m not forcing anyone to do it.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.560
But I’m going to do it.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800
I’ve decided to become a cop.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.360
If I ignore this,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.080
I won’t deserve to be called a police officer.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.640
Then I’ll do it too.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.400
If he’s in then I’m also in.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.120
Me too.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.000
Tharn, are you sure?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.840
Just one false move,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.080
your dream for joining the special investigation force in order to investigate about your dad’s death would all be shattered.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.560
If you do something good, some good things will surely happen to you.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.720
Think of it as a test before we’d officially become a cop.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.480
What are they doing here?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.840
They said they lost something at the beach.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.000
So, they asked if they could check the CCTV camera dated 2 days back.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.920
2 nights ago?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.880
I’ve checked the CCTV camera.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.920
I couldn’t see Lieut Tam anywhere.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.600
What did you say? Thongthai and Kem wanted to see the island map?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.160
Yes, sir.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:20.240
Baby
Baby and I got new information.
Baby, tell them what we’ve got.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.960
Don't you see it?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.880
I did some research on the tidal pattern of the sea level.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.800
There are 2 tidal patterns in the Gulf of Thailand
Diurnal tides and Mixed tides.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.680
In the Andaman, it’s only Semidiurnal tides.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.440
Wow, you’re so good at this, Baby. How come I never knew it before.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.320
Because you were always falling asleep in class.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.160
Absolutely right.
Geez.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.480
I checked the CCTV on the day
that Lieut Tam was said to be seen near his lodging.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.960
I couldn’t see him anywhere.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.160
Let’s compare the info you’ve got with the night
that Lieut Tam was said to commit suicide.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.920
There was a depression that night.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:34.080
Suppose Lieut Tam did commit suicide on the beach,
it was impossible to find his body on the shore.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.000
Unless…

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.920
he killed himself at the other side of this island.
The tide would then carry his body back to shore.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.920
Then we need to find more evidence there.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.840
Do you really think there’d be anything left for you to find out there?
Well, in case the evidence lies under the sea.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.720
The body was carried by the tides, wasn’t it?
It didn’t fall down from the sky.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.720
Why are you surprised?

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.040
I did learn about it, you know.
Shut up, Khem.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.080
I need to think.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.200
Master Phaya.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.120
Master Phaya.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.720
Master Sakunanopparuj, this way please.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.880
Phaya!

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.280
Phaya!

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.320
What the hell are you doing, Phaya?

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.720
Phaya.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.280
Phaya.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200
Th…Tharn.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.080
That voice…

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.840
Was it you?

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.640
What are you talking about?

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.000
Get yourself together.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.800
Tharn.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.280
Why do you look like that person in my dream?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.480
What are you trying to do?

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.080
Do you think you’re a real officer now?

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.560
No, sir.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.920
But isn’t it our job as a police officer to find out the truth?

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.720
Is it?

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.960
But I don’t see any police officer here.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.040
Being a cop isn’t just about showing off or being mister smarty pants.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.840
Do you really understand the meaning of ‘duty’?!
Or ‘rules and regulations?! Or even ‘discipline’?!

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.240
Just do your job and mind your own business!

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.280
But we did all that
because we wanted to proof Lieut Tam didn’t kill himself.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.840
You also think the same too, don’t you.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.040
What I think about this case is none of your business.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.160
If you want to become a real cop,
you must learn to be responsible for your job.
Know your job and do your best with it.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.240
What you did tonight is a serious breach of discipline.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.680
If I find you doing anything like this again,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.440
you will not get another second chance.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.000
you will be expelled immediately!

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.200
Got it?

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.200
Hooya!

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.680
Do you get it?!

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.800
Hooya!

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.800
And not just the two of them.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.840
But including everyone who takes part in this silly game too.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.400
If you know that your name is in here,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.440
come to the front.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.120
NOW!

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.680
You all have committed a shameful act
by violating the camp regulations…

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.480
and disobeyed your superior’s orders.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.200
It is considered a serious breach of discipline.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.360
You have no rights to stick your nose
into the official authority’s business.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.600
If you really think you are good enough…

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.080
and want to bring justice to Lieut Tam,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.320
just do your best in what you’re assigned to do.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.640
Pass the exam and become a real cop.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.080
I’ll keep watching to see…

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.800
if a smartass who is crying for justice like you…

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.280
Would only bark but not bite.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.080
And since you’ve done something wrong tonight,

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.200
you will be punished so that the others will not follow suit.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.480
Prepare for stress position!

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.680
Hooya!

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.960
Captain, I’ve looked at the evidence that
those kids could find. They were quite good.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.480
It’d be great if they can join the special investigation team.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.280
It doesn’t matter how talented they are,
if they can’t follow the rules and be disciplined…

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.440
those talents are just a waste.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.320
Guys,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.000
I’m…

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.520
I’m really sorry.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.720
for making us all in trouble.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480
It’s all right.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.120
Just forget it.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.000
What’s done is done.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.160
Yeah.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.360
We were acting like a smartass just like what Captain said.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.040
I think what he said was actually right.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.360
For us to become a good cop, we stick to the rules

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.560
Starting from passing the exam first.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.280
I will definitely pass it.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:07.200
Then I’ll shout in his face that I’m on the special investigation team.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.480
Me too.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.760
Let’s do our best to pass the exam.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.640
Let’s do it.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.280
Yeah.
Hooya!

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.320
Hooya!

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.760
Bring it on.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.040
Go on, Tharn!

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.160
Go!

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.639
(Shooting sound)

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.159
(Shooting sound)

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.679
Time’s up.
It’s a tie.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.920
Are you filming an MV or what? It’s time to bed.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.680
I was just pondering about something.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.760
Does a person like you have anything to ponder about?

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.680
I have a question that needed an answer.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.720
Oh, you’re quite serious, aren’t you?

00:35:48.800 --> 00:36:00.680
Tharn, do you believe in the past lives or reincarnation?

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.600
I do. The Abbot often told me about it.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:13.520
That what we did in our past life will affect us in this life.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.320
Like what people said,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.080
Everything happens for a reason. There’s no coincidence.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:30.480
It happens because it has already been destined by something called…

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.200
Commitment.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.760
Yeah.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:43.280
You were born into this family of yours, and surrounded by your friends…

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.400
Because you might have had some commitment with those people in the past life.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:59.160
So, you’re telling me that the reason I’ve you in this life…

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.600
is because we had a commitment in our past lives.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.800
What if it’s true?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.240
What did you promise me?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.760
Is that why you’re always there to rescue me?

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.880
That’s the question that I need to know an answer.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.400
What’s the reason behind this?

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:47.800
In the past life, I was probably a rich and kind-hearted man who liked to rescue cows like you from the slaughter house.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.560
Asshole.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:58.520
Or you were probably a caring wife who always took a great care of a good-looking hubby like me.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:06.520
I see. This is what a handsome cow looks like.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.600
- Now, you’re pissing me off.
- Ouch! I was just kidding.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.640
Just stop thinking about it.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.720
What are you going to do after the training is done?

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.320
If I can pass the exam, I’ll surely have something more interesting to do.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.000
What about you?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
If I pass the exam, I’ll do what I’ve always wanted to do.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.320
What is it?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.040
Can you stop being nosy?

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.040
Let’s go. It’s time for bed or else we’d get punished again.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.640
The instructors are keeping their eyes on us.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.120
The instructors are keeping their eyes on us.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.160
Hey, wait for me!

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.000
Tharn!

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.240
Please come to the front when I call out your name.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.880
Mr. Pathorn Pengprai.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.720
Mr. Yingyai Mahanop.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.640
Mr. Phaya Kamolwipak.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.320
Mr. Songyod Maliwan

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.000
Mr. Wansa Raksil.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.160
Salute!

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.160
Turn around!

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.920
Salute!

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.360
Captain.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.640
What is it?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.920
We did it.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.000
You just passed the training. Don’t be so full of yourself.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.120
You haven’t been on a real mission yet.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.680
It’s a lot more tough.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.320
You couldn’t believe it, could you?

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.640
That people like us would be able to pass the exam and be on the special investigation team.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.760
Thank you, Captaion.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.680
We’re looking forward to working with you, Captain.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.040
One day, we’d proof it to you that we are able to be a great cop.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.640
I’ll wait for that day.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.560
Yes, sir.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.480
- Well done.
- Thank you.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.640
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.440
Bravo!

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.920
What a relief.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.360
Hello, grandma. I finally did it.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.000
I’m now a police officer.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.840
Next, I’m going to find out about my parent’s death.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.960
I’ll find some time to visit you soon.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.280
Please take care.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.320
Tharn.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.720
Can I borrow your phone?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.760
Phone?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.160
Yeah.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.120
That’s my number.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.280
But I didn’t ask.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.520
But I want you to have it.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.120
Are you stalking me?

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.960
I want to give you this cap.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.600
Are you copying me?

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.600
If you could do it to me, why can’t I do it too?

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.120
Did you just take a photo of me?

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.000
I’m going to use it as a calling ID.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.200
Why didn’t you tell me first so that I could pose for it?

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.480
You already look nice.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.000
I like it.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.800
I’ll store your number as…

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.480
Bolster.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.320
I’ll give you ca call. Let’s go out and find something to eat.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.800
Think of it as returning the favor for always helping me.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.960
No need.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.440
I don’t want to see you that often.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.080
But I do.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.480
So what?

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.400
Hey

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.880
Hey, are you guys going to stay over at the camp?

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.600
Don’t you want to go home?

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.560
Go pack your things. I want to go home so badly.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.040
I’ll call you.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.920
Bolster.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.280
- Let’s go, Yai.
- ‘kay.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.680
Bolster?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.320
You like him, don’t you?

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.400
No.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.440
He’s so annoying. Why would I like him?

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.680
Just tell me honestly if you like him.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.640
I’m going to help protect him too.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:30.200
Tharn, I really hope you’d find that someone you like.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.520
And be with someone you love.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.920
I thought you already know…

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.720
that if I love someone,

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.000
that person will die.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.240
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.160
I don’t want to feel that kind of grief anymore.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.360
We have a week to rest before starting our work at the unit. Let’s go party, shall we?

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.000
I’m in. We were stuck in this training camp for 7 months.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.360
I really miss all those fun and the crowds.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.120
I miss the old days.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.200
Khem, are you thinking about your ex?

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.640
I like that. But you’re getting me in trouble.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.880
Right now, I only have eyes for my baby.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.160
So, are we going?

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.760
Yai and I have to go back to Nong Khai province.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.600
I’m worried about the Abbot. We’ve left him alone for too long.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.440
And we won’t have much time to look after him once we start working.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.200
You’re from Nong Khai?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.200
Yeah.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.280
So, do we have to go to Nong Khai?

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.280
You seem interested in him a lot.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680
Okay, listen up.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.320
Just come to Nongkai with us tonight.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.560
I’ll send you the time and place.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.680
But first, let me tell my wife that I’m going home.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400
See you.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.120
- Bye.
- See ya.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.320
Tharn, let’s meet at the car.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.320
Hi, sweety.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.200
- See you.
- Okay.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760
See you.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.400
Cheers!

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.880
- Are you okay, Tharn?
- Yes.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.760
- It’s just one bottle.
- I’ve just arrived.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.960
Are you okay?

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.120
Aren’t you the one who’s not good at drinking, Khem?

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:07.880
This way, Phaya! He’s here.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.320
Wow, he’s looking good.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.520
Oh, what a head turner. All the girls are looking at him.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.480
- Come sit down. Hey, scoot over.
- Hey, scoot over.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.120
Here, take a swig.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.320
- Now?
- You’re late so take a swig.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:31.000
If anyone got you as a boyfriend, he or she would surely have a headache. You’re so popular.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.400
- Yeah, so handsome.
- Babe, don’t make fun of him.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.320
Listen, I’m telling you right here…

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.320
I only have eyes for the one I love.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.200
If I love anyone…

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.000
I’ll never…

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.920
(Phone ringing)

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.200
Talking about the devil…

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.080
Wow, who’s she? So gorgeous.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.120
- So beautiful.
- Khem.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120
Gorgeous, isn’t she?

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.720
- Is your girlfriend calling?
- Khem, you jerk.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.520
He’s embarrassed.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.000
- Where are you going?
- I have to take this call.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.800
So sweet.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.560
What a sweet couple.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.000
- Cheers!
- Okay.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.320
Do you want anything? I’m going to place an order.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.480
- I want one of this.
- Me too.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.400
- Make it three.
- Okay, three bottles then.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.760
Hurry up and get back.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.440
Five bottles of beer, please.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.200
Can I have two on the rock, please?

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.080
Hello.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.560
Hello.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.680
Are you here with your friends?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.320
Yes.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.840
They seem to enjoy it a lot.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.320
My name is Oat.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.240
I’m Tharn.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.760
Nice to meet you.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.880
Same here.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.160
This one is on me.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.560
Did you order this for me?

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.480
Thanks a lot, pal.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.360
You really know what I like.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.720
who’s this?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.440
I’m Oat.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.960
Excuse me, but I’m talking to my friend, not you.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.880
So, are you done ordering?

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.040
Let’s go.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.160
Does any of you want to come up and sing a song together?

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.640
I do, I do.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.640
- ‘I’m a local girl from…’
- Khem!

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.880
- What?
- Sorry.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.920
Anyone?

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.840
I can do it, Yai.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.440
- Thongthai, you go then.
- No

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.400
- Go on.
- You go, Phaya.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.960
- What?
- You’re good at singing.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.840
- What are you talking about?
- I heard you sing before.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.960
- I can’t sing.
- I’ll go then.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.280
- ‘I’m a local girl from Chiangmai…’
-Excuse me? My friend wants to join you.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.600
Come on up here.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.000
- Go, Phaya. / - Yeah.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.240
Are you chicken out?

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.160
That’s my boy. Just a swig to boost up your guts.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.040
- I’ll show you.
- Yeah, that’s my friend, everyone.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.480
Do you need anything, I’ll go get it for you.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.280
- Mine is done. Get me one of this.
- Me too. I’ll have one too.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.600
Make it five, Tharn. Five bottles of beer.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.920
(Music)

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.120
Let’s play some game.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120
What game?

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.640
Spin The Bottle game.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.280
- Let’s clear the table.
- Okay

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.400
- But I’m going to alter the rule a bit.
- How?

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.680
If the bottle points toward anyone, that person can ask anyone a question.

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.200
- Okay
- Let’s do that.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.720
If the you couldn’t answer the question, you must down the glass.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.000
- We’ll surely get drunk.
- Who’s it?

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.560
- Who’s it?
- What the fuck are you doing, Yai?

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.960
Don’t worry, my bro. I’ll take care of it.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.320
- Come on
- Bring it on.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.880
- Let’s start.
- Who’s first?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.360
It’s me.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.440
Go on then.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.480
Whom do you want to ask?

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.480
I’m going to ask Tharn.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920
Go on.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.480
Do you have anyone you like right now?

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.480
Answer, answer, answer!

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.760
- Booo.
- What a waste.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.760
I’ll ask Tharn.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.800
It has to be like this, bro.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.800
Here we go.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.560
Again?

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.720
Go on.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:50.760
What’s your type? Is it someone around here?

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:57.120
Answer, answer, answer!

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.240
Geez.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.160
You!

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.320
I’ll ask Tharn.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.560
Hold on. That’s enough.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.320
Easy there.

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.200
Let’s stop. Look at him, he’s all red.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.840
Fine, I won’t ask him then.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.320
- I’ll ask you instead.
- Oh, it’s your turn now.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.760
Just sit down.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.720
Listen.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.800
If you can pick anyone in this table to go home with you,

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.720
whom will you choose?

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.560
Answer it.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.520
Answer, answer, answer!

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.080
- I’m going to choose…
- Yes?

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.000
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.880
Tharn!

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.200
Tharn! Are you okay?

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.720
We shouldn’t have picked on him.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.560
Tharn, are you all right?

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.720
I’ll take him to wash up first.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.560
No more drinking, okay?

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.080
Let’s go.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.320
Geez. I was afraid he’d puke all over me.

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.560
Are they actually….?

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.600
Are you okay?

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.800
Wash your face first.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.360
Geez.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.080
Sit down. Sit.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.440
Already.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.600
- Hey.
- Huh?

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.800
- Are you okay?
- Yeahh.

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.440
If you want to feel better,

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.440
I have this.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.000
It’d help.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.440
I’ll make it for you.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.600
Just stay still.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.440
Don’t move.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.880
Open your mouth.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:38.800
Drink it

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:50.120
- Feel better?
- Umm, yeah.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.080
Very good.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:58.280
- Let’s freshen you up a bit.
- Geez, what’s wrong with you?

00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.720
Take this.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.240
You really like for bugging me.

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.560
- Get off me.
- No.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.880
I’m not going to let you go. I’ll hold on to you tight.

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.760
You, evil jellyfish.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.080
Are you sure? This jellyfish’s sting is very painful.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.840
It will go directly to your heart.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.040
The heart, the heart, the heart.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.600
Stop it. You’re like a baby when you’re drunk.

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.760
Let me return the favor.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.040
What’s wrong?

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.320
Where did you get this necklace from?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.920
This amulet?

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.160
It’s the same.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720
Same as what?

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.760
Same as the amulet that I used to give to a boy.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.440
You used to give a boy an amulet like this?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.520
Yeah.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.680
When? Where?

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.240
Tell me more about it.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.280
It was when…

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.800
Yes?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.120
When…

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.760
Hey, wake up. Talk to me first.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.440
Geez, Tharn.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.080
Sit down first.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.400
- Wake up. Tell me where was it?
- It was…

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.600
Tharn.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.840
Tharn.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.320
Tharn.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.560
Talk to me first.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.160
Shit! I’m sorry.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.920
Wait! It’s not what you think.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.960
It’s good that you’re here. He’s already passed out. What to do now?

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.280
I thought so. He drank a gallon of it.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.720
Now, what?

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.880
Okay, I know what to do.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.840
You go and drop him off at his condo.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.600
But I’m drunk too. I can’t do that.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.240
So am I. I’m going to call a cab for you.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.280
Come here.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.000
- Sit down.
- What the heck are you doing?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.480
Ouch!

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.920
- Geez, he’s heavy.
- Yai!

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.720
- Hang on.
- Now, go.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.600
Where?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.680
Wait for me in front of the club. I’ll let you know when the cab is here.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:25.080
Tharn, my bro. I’ve done everything I could for you.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.960
Geez, what’s wrong with him?

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.240
Where are you taking me?

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.760
Your place.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.040
Go back and get Yai too.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.200
I don’t want to sleep alone.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.200
I’ll stay with you.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.560
But first, get off me.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.280
Where’s the cab?

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.080
Just wait here.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.240
Sorry

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.480
Just wait here.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.040
Shit, whose car is it?

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.080
- Dr. Chalothorn.
- Tharn.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.560
Excuse me?

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.240
Tharn and I have known Dr. Chalothorn since we were young.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.280
Good for him. Now, he’d someone to take care of him when he’s drunk.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:55.640
Grandma, maybe it’s time for me to find out…

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.240
what those dreams actually mean.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.720
I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.080
Phaya.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.520
Tharn. Why are you here?

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:31.400
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:47.360
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:57.320
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:12.720
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:20.000
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.200
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:32.120
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
