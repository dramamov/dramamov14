00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.280
Take her away.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.640
Yes.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.800
Her time of death

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.320
is slightly earlier than

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.200
those three male victims

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
found yesterday.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.000
I believe

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.680
her body was already there

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.080
when the police discovered

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.140
those three male victims yesterday.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.979
What's your evidence?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.800
Well.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.920
Those three male victims

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.240
all showed symptoms of hypothermia.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.080
But one of them, named Guo Yiliang,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.240
compared to the other two victims,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.640
had an additional symptom.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.200
Pathologically, it presents as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.000
extensive necrosis of the subendocardial contraction bands in the left ventricular free wall,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.660
resulting in non-obstructive coronary myocardial infarction.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.680
Don't look so confused.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.280
In simple terms,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.140
he was literally scared to death.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.440
I've been puzzled about something

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.800
that I couldn't figure out.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.280
These sculptures in the abandoned houses,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.840
they do look quite strange in appearance.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.400
Someone unfamiliar with them might

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.160
get the creeps at first glance.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.480
But regardless,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.840
they shouldn't be enough

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
to literally frighten a healthy young man to death.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.800
But now I believe

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.200
we've found the answer.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880
I had previously speculated

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.560
whether the deaths of these three men

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.160
could have been caused by accidental factors.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.079
Hypothermia,

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.600
oxygen deprivation, and shock.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.680
These could be non-human factors.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.280
But now with

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.480
the appearance of this female victim's body,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200
I believe the possibility of accidental death

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.730
can basically be ruled out.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.880
But now a new question arises.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.640
If it was deliberate,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.280
then how was this environment of hypothermia

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.600
and oxygen deprivation created?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.680
In a locked-room murder,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.160
the most important thing is to ensure airtightness.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.280
Wei told me before

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.160
they took measures to seal doors and windows

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.020
to prevent insects from damaging

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.360
these wooden sculptures.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.560
That's not enough.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.160
It also needs to be airtight.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.600
They would need to use external materials

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.720
to transform this room

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840
into a completely sealed space.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.400
Then use some special methods

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.400
to turn this sealed space into a low-temperature,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.440
oxygen-deprived environment.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.920
Your analysis makes a lot of sense,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
but what kind of special methods

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.680
are you referring to?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.800
What could they be?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.040
Look at this.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.079
This vine's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040
upper part has withered,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.200
but the roots are growing normally

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.260
and remain intact.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.320
I believe it's liquid nitrogen.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120
If the liquid nitrogen

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.680
entered this room,

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.440
the temperature would drop.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.920
The vines near the window

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.800
would deteriorate faster

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.600
due to the temperature drop.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.920
But the roots

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
continued to grow

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.200
because their temperature remained stable.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.330
But how did the liquid nitrogen get in?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.940
This is the answer.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.519
Liquid nitrogen is similar to dry ice.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.959
It creates a white misty fog.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.680
The colder the room gets,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680
the more scared they become.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.240
And the more scared they are,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760
the less likely they can escape from the storage room.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.090
Everything matches up.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.880
I'll arrange for someone to collect samples

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.610
and take them back for testing.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.400
Chi Xia.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240
What do you think?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.920
I don't have much experience with crime scene investigation.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.680
We can't find any more clues,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.040
but from a criminal psychology perspective,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.680
there are several questions I can't figure out.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.080
Why would the killer give the four victims

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.680
different methods of death?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.440
Complicated death methods

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.560
would multiply the risk of committing the crime.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200
In such a remote mountain environment,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.680
spending enormous effort

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.440
to create a cold,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.080
frightening,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.880
oxygen-deprived environment.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200
It's like they're

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.400
performing some kind of ritual.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.080
The second question is:

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.610
how many killers are there?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.320
Placing a female victim

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.960
in a predetermined location

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.680
and killing three adult males

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.280
doesn't seem like a task one person could accomplish.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.570
The third question:

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.160
the connection between the three adult males is

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.000
they all belonged to the same outdoor club.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.760
Now there's a fourth victim

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.980
who is also female.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.960
Does this connection still exist?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.040
Leave this to me.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040
I'll look into it.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.600
We are guilty.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.120
I found it.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.180
Five years ago,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.360
there was a rescue accident in Yuji.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.520
A group of hikers went up the mountain

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.640
without filing a report.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.720
As a result, because they were unfamiliar with the terrain,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.200
they got stranded on the mountain.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.320
At that time, there was a villager

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.400
who organized a volunteer rescue team.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.730
It was this rescue team.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.760
Did someone die in that rescue operation?

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.560
Yes.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.720
The rescue team leader was named Zhao Shengqian,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.760
and he was the only one who died.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.520
Everyone else was rescued.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560
This incident caused quite a stir online at the time.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.960
Wei,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.560
don't rush.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.520
Tell us more details.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.850
Thank you, Captain Luo.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.000
Five years ago,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.160
Yuji became a popular adventure destination in the area.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.720
Many adventure enthusiasts came because of its reputation.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.320
However,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560
not all mountains in the area were open to the public.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.600
Including the one

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.200
where we found the body, Death Mountain.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.240
Sir, may I ask you

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.160
how to get to Death Mountain?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.000
Why are you asking about that place?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.840
We're from out of town.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.680
We heard it's interesting,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.560
and we want to check it out.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.360
Interesting?

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.840
Just listen to the name of the mountain.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.080
Does that sound like a fun place?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.010
What do you mean?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.880
There was a brave contractor before

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.760
who built a resort on the mountain.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.920
But accidents kept happening on the mountain.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.000
Eventually,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.640
no one dared to go there anymore.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.920
His business became worse and worse,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.280
and later the resort was abandoned.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.800
Such a creepy mountain

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.080
plus dozens of old, dilapidated houses.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.920
Aren't you afraid of attracting something unwanted?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.480
What do you want?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.409
Grab it quickly.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.040
Come on, take it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.560
Coming.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.920
Actually,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.120
we're not going up the mountain.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480
Just walking around at the foot of it.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480
Taking some photos

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.520
to show off later.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.800
How much?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.320
In total,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.040
46.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.520
Here's 50.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.450
Keep the change.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.640
Thank you.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.700
How do we get there?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.760
Just keep walking this way

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.960
until you see a small stream.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.160
But,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.840
just stay at the foot of the mountain.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.000
Don't go up there under any circumstances.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.400
It's dangerous up there.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.320
Thanks, boss.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.440
Thanks, boss.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.720
- Take care.
- Take care.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720
What would you like?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.880
There were actually quite a few groups of people that day.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.960
After they entered Death Mountain,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.620
the stall owner kept an eye out

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.920
and waited nearby.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200
Sure enough, there was a group of people

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.400
who never came back down.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.240
The owner got worried

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.000
and called the police.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.200
But you know,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.640
people in their twenties or thirties

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.840
could be wandering anywhere.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.400
Everyone searched the entire village first

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.440
but couldn't find them.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.680
Only then did they go up the mountain for rescue.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.440
How many people were in the rescue team?

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.240
Eight people.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.360
They weren't professional rescuers,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.760
just kids who grew up in the village,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.680
who ran barefoot on the mountain since childhood.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.240
The leader of the rescue team

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.480
was Zhao Shengqian.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.160
He was only 26 years old at the time.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.960
In the end,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.640
he not only lost his life

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.040
but also his reputation.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.200
Why?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.120
Saving people is a good deed.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.360
Exactly.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.280
The trapped people were rescued,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.200
the rescuers sacrificed themselves.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.960
They should have been honored,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.280
so why did his reputation suffer?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.160
That's why people say his death was unjust.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.720
Actually, many people went up Death Mountain that day.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.520
Most people were found early on,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.680
but there were still a few left,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.560
and the rescue was extremely difficult.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.960
Some people suggested

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.000
that rescue wasn't necessary,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.130
but Zhao Shengqian refused to give up.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.400
Take it slow.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.809
Let the others catch up.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.640
You take these people back to the village first.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.299
I'll go back and search again.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.080
Captain,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.880
are you crazy?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.760
It's getting dark soon.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.919
This is Death Mountain,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.380
no one returns from there.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.200
Yes, Captain.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.160
That's right.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.570
Don't worry, everyone.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.880
I've been to Death Mountain

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.600
more times than all of you combined.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600
It's fine.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.240
Captain.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240
Let me go with you.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.880
No need.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.960
Your leg is in bad shape.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.040
You need to make sure

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.200
these people get down safely.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.640
I have to go back and search again.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.880
If I don't find anyone, I'll leave.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.680
Before dark,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.120
I'll definitely be back.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.240
Captain,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
let me go with you.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.680
I've studied wilderness survival

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.080
and know basic emergency medical care.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.640
Captain.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.840
Take Feiyu with you.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.040
It's really not safe for you to go alone.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.760
Let's go.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.600
Watch your step.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.330
Keep moving.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.240
Then Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu had an accident.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.920
Yes.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.360
The other rescue team members

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.760
escorted the people they had found down the mountain first.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.000
Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu took food and water

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.920
and continued searching for survivors.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.520
After that,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.850
three more days passed.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.040
The rest of the people gradually came down from the mountain.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.440
But Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.720
never came down.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.640
So the villagers

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.160
organized another search party to go up the mountain.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.360
They finally found Zhao Shengqian dead

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.820
and Qu Feiyu unconscious.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.160
What about Zhao Shengqian?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.240
What was his cause of death?

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.080
Did you investigate?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.800
Yes, we did.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.800
Zhao Shengqian suffered from hunger,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.360
dehydration,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360
and hypothermia.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.080
It led to exhaustion,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.840
causing him to fall down a cliff,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.200
dying from severe head trauma.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.330
What about Qu Feiyu?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.040
Qu Feiyu was in a coma for three whole months.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.440
She escaped death,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.720
but not without consequences.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.840
Since she woke up,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840
she's been blind.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.000
Um...

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.920
What about the ruined reputation?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.280
What happened?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600
After Zhao Shengqian's body was found,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.480
reporters

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.640
interviewed Shi Guangxuan who was still

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.600
under observation in the hospital.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.330
As a result, this Shi Guangxuan

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.040
accused Zhao Shengqian of lacking professional skills,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.600
claiming that during the rescue,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.800
he put others at risk.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.280
Zhao Shengqian was dead.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720
Qu Feiyu was in a coma.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.360
Of course people believed

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.020
whatever the survivors said.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520
They weren't a professional rescue team to begin with.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.240
Many people online latched onto this point and started criticizing them.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.040
How did this matter end?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.920
As time passed,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.880
people forgot about it.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.410
The rescue team disbanded.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.480
Qu Feiyu wasn't a local,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.210
so she left Yuji shortly after.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.480
The living continued with their lives.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.160
It's just that

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.560
Zhao Shengqian and his family were quite pitiful.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.360
Xiao Wei.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.880
Could I trouble you to make another trip?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.360
Please go ahead.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.720
Find out about

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.680
Zhao Shengqian's family's current information

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.640
and let me know.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.960
Also about those rescue team members from back then.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.760
Okay.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.660
Does it feel familiar?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.680
What?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.240
The 12 sculptures.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.000
The words 'We are guilty.'

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.500
And revenge again.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.800
Doesn't it seem like Fox's work?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.200
Indeed.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800
But we have limited clues right now.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.920
We don't know who Fox's

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.200
next target will be.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.960
If it's really her,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.640
where would the 25 be?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.280
Okay.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.280
I got it.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.900
I just had Curly check something.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.400
This Qu Feiyu left the country three months ago

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.160
with no record of returning.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.240
Makes sense when you think about it.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.120
A completely blind person

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.960
may have a motive

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.000
but hardly has the ability to commit these crimes.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.300
She's probably not Fox's target.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.840
Captain Luo.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.370
Miss Xia.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.560
Wei.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.600
Could you tell me about

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.680
Zhao Shengqian's wife in detail?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.720
Sure.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.040
Zhao Shengqian's wife

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.960
is named Feng Yuqin.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.600
Since Zhao Shengqian died,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.920
Feng Yuqin's personality has become very strange.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.320
She often gets into huge arguments

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.240
She often gets into huge arguments

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.760
with neighbors over trivial matters.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.440
Our station has mediated many times.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.560
She now survives on odd jobs

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.000
while taking care of Zhao's mother

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.480
and a 7-year-old child.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.880
Because of her personality, she's offended many people,

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.800
so her social circle is quite limited.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.600
In short,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.600
she's difficult to get along with.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.640
Resentful,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.520
quiet,

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.850
and socially isolated.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.360
Such people are easily manipulated by Fox.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.930
This is the restaurant.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.860
This is Feng Yuqin.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.880
Here's your vegetable platter.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:43.920
Wei.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.560
Go ask Feng Yuqin to come out.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.000
We need to get some information from her.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.640
Okay.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.090
For table three.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.160
Feng Yuqin.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.920
Two officials from the city are here.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.920
They want to know about Zhao Shengqian's rescue mission five years ago.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.760
Please cooperate with them.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.560
What?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.720
Wasn't everything made clear enough back then?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720
Since I've found you,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.520
it means there are more details to add.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.440
Put down what you're doing first.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:06.920
Please cooperate.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.600
I can't.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.720
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.520
Rice noodles.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.530
Didn't I order noodles?

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.720
Then where are my rice noodles?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.400
Not cooperating.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400
Always like this.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.520
How long have I been waiting?

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.600
Here.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.880
Didn't I tell you to serve table 3?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.940
Take it over there.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.120
Who are you slamming things at?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.880
I wasn't even angry yet.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.440
What are you throwing things for?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.640
Don't make trouble.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400
Didn't I just bring it to you?

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.960
What's with your attitude?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.840
Looking for trouble, huh?

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.440
Eat it if you want.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.320
If not, leave.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.120
No, you...

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.200
Brother.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.240
Calm down.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.970
Take it easy.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.760
Boss.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.780
Make a new bowl for my friend here.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.800
It's on me.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.280
Alright.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.760
Serve him first.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.560
I'm not in a hurry.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.280
Also,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.560
your employee Feng Yuqin.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.480
I need to borrow some of her time.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.280
I've already told you many times.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.800
What else is there to say now?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.540
That rescue team back then

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.600
was trapped on the mountain for many days.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.040
Captain Zhao was experienced

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.640
and successfully rescued all of them in the end.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.440
But he

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.980
not only lost his life,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.680
but was also slandered

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.720
and his reputation was ruined.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.360
That's why you've been living

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.760
under everyone's gossip.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.120
Have you ever thought about

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.580
changing this situation?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.200
Nothing changed five years ago.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.490
What's the point of thinking about it now?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.960
When Zhao Shengqian was around,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.680
your quality of life must have been pretty good.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.520
Now you can only work as a helper in this restaurant.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.320
Such a big difference.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.040
After all this time,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.520
do you feel any resentment?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.250
Resentment?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.650
Can resentment feed me?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.920
What's past is past.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.200
If I dwell on it too much,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.800
how can I go on with my life?

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.960
Listen, officer,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160
are you here today

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.480
to learn about the old case

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.960
or just to laugh at me?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.080
Feng Yuqin,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.730
what's with your attitude?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.080
Did I just help you for nothing?

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080
Don't be so ungrateful.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.960
Let me tell you something.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.080
We have reasonable suspicion

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.200
that you harbor resentment toward the hikers who were rescued 5 years ago,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.320
and might be seeking revenge on behalf of Zhao Shengqian

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.920
and possibly murdered them.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.400
If you feel you're being wrongly accused,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.320
please cooperate seriously with our investigation.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.120
Revenge.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.520
I only blame Zhao Shengqian for being too helpful back then,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.320
bringing trouble upon himself.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.920
I have no desire to avenge him

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.600
and get myself into trouble.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.520
I just want to take care of

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.480
the elderly and children in my family.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.640
If you insist on making things difficult for me...

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.760
Just arrest me

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.600
and let the elderly and children

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.240
starve to death at home.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.200
No,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.880
we don't mean to give you a hard time.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.640
We just want to understand your thoughts better

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.040
so we can help you.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.200
My thoughts?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.090
Do my thoughts even matter?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320
It's been 5 years.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.920
The civilian search and rescue association insists

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.720
there were problems with Zhao Shengqian's rescue operation.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.120
Now the compensation can't even be issued.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.520
You police officers,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.160
can't you do something about it?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.680
You don't deal with people like this,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.240
but instead you give me,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.240
the victim's family member,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.300
a hard time, right?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.520
What's wrong with you today?

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.040
I...

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.640
Why are you so hot-tempered?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.760
Feng Yuqin is just a suspect.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.520
Why are you jumping to conclusions

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.380
and treating her like a criminal?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.480
I think having enthusiasm

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.010
for the case is a good thing.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.880
But let me give you some advice.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.200
In the future, focus on the case itself

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.130
rather than on solving it quickly.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.920
Being impatient won't close the case.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.960
Only when you have evidence

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.620
can the case be closed, right?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.170
Don't let your emotions

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.620
affect your behavior.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.360
I'm sorry about today.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.160
I admit I was too impulsive today.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.000
But I promise

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
from now on,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.400
I'll definitely follow orders.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.600
I won't act rashly anymore.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.660
Alright, let's go.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.400
Keep looking for other clues.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.320
But we need to

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.600
keep someone watching Feng Yuqin.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.200
Got it.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.180
Based on Fox's usual style of operation,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.560
she can even manipulate an elderly person like Zheng Lanshu.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.220
But how did she manage to do it?

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.079
I suspect

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.079
this Buddha head was once suspended.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.760
Why?

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.599
Usually when people are in an enclosed space,

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.920
where would they hide?

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.170
