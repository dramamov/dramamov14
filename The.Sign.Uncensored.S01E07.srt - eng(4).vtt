The characters, actions and places are fictional.
There is no intention to disrespect any authority, profession or community. Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.720
But I kept dreaming about the same thing...

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.560
and you were always there in those dreams.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.160
Don’t you think it’s the same as when you have your vision?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.720
Do you remember what I told you earlier?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.200
That you are in danger.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.560
That’s why I want you to stay by my side so that I can protect you.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.960
But it’s Doc that I’m going with.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.120
I will take him away from you if even he has to die.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.440
What the fuck are you saying?!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.800
Let me go!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880
Are you going to the art exhibition too?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.760
Yes.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.280
Please go to the exhibition with me.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.640
Yes, Grandma.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760
Hey, you’re here too?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.800

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.880
Let’s finish your work.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.160
I know it’s what you’ve always wanted to do.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.520
You don’t have to do this.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.800
I want you...

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.840
to cherish the feeling we have for each other...

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.159
and keep it alive within this collection of your work.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.960
So that one day...

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.040
when I see it, I’d think of you.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.880
Okay.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.280
(Music)

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.400
I love how you look at every piece of your artwork.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.440
Your eyes are filled with passion,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.240
mystery,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.240
strength,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.640
and tenderness.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.640
Love. It’s love.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.880
I put my soul into my work.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.680
I am your art.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.240
I belong to you.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.200
Yes.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.760
Yes.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.240
Please promise me.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.520
Even when everything changes,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.840
never change the way you look at me.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.640
You are getting married.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.080
You are getting married.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.280
You are going to have a new beginning in your life.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.000

You are leaving me for a better life.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.000
You are leaving me for a better life.

Art.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.080
Please promise me that you will never forget me.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920
Never forget the time we have spent together.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.920
Why did you do this to me?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.360
- Why?
- Because I love you.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840
Do you know you’re torturing me?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.280
I need you.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.600
I don’t want to lose you.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.600
I don’t want to lose you.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.000
I’m here, Art.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.640
I’m here.

(Classical Music)

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.400
I’m already here.

(Thunder Sound)

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.240
Inspector, the VIP guest will arrive in less than an hour.
Tharn and Yai, go back to your position.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.160
Yes, sir.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.320
Tharn, I think you should stop looking for that man.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.960
What else can you do when you’ve found him?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.200
Are you going to tell him that you saw a vision that he is the culprit...
and then arrest him?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.280
I’m not going to arrest him.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.920
I just want to ask him something so that he might come to his sense.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.680
Can’t you just let it go?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.760
But we are a police officer, Yai.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.960
Are you going to let innocent people get hurt or die?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.960
But I can’t let you die either.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.360
How many times have you risked your life to save the others because of your vision?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.480
Just do your best and let it be.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.840
Don’t you remember what the Abbot told us?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.320
That sometimes you have to let the karma does its work.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.280
I can’t do that.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.000
Now that I know what’s going to happen, I have to help him.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.480
What about the VIP guest? You agreed to take this job...

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.320
because you want to see him, didn’t you?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.280
Think about it and choose wisely, Tharn.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.160
Who are you looking for?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.040
Oh, just my friend.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.920
Hmm, a friend?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.320
Oh, is that Wi? We’re here!

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.760
I haven’t seen you for ages. I thought you already disappeared.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.880
- Good evening, Grandma.
- Good evening.
How are you doing?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.320
I’m doing well. I haven’t seen you for so long. You hardly come visit me.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.920
I just open my art gallery so I’m a little busy.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.560
Hello, Phaya.
Hello.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.440
And this is...

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.680
Oh, her name is Dujdao. She’s my junior friend when I studied in France.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.520
Hello, I’m Dao. You must be Wi. He often told me about you.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.520
Really? What did he tell you?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.160
She’s my friend too.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.880
You can ask me if you want to know anything about her.
I know a lot more than he does.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.320
I’ll tell you later then.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.960
Hold on. Before you’re going to disclose my personal info, have you asked for my permission?

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.840
Serve you right, cheeky monkey.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.880
Grandma, please help. They are ganging up on me.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.240
I also agree with them.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.360
Awwww

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.760
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.200
Wait, is that Phaya?

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.800
Why is he here?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.280
I don’t know.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.560
Is she the girl who came to see him at our unit?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
But who’s the other girl?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.840
No idea too.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.400
Maybe she’s also his friend.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.520
I don’t think so. As a relationship guru,
I’m sure both of them are not his friends.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.640
One is probably his girlfriend. The other must be his fling.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.320
Let’s get to work.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.920
Please excuse me,
I have to get ready for the exhibition. It’s going to start soon.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.840
- See you later then.
- Okay

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.720
See you.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.160
Tell everyone to get ready in their position.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.160
Yes, Inspector.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.000
The VIP guest is going to arrive in 10 minutes.
Yes, sir.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.000
Tharn, stay focus. Don’t try to do something silly, okay?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.400
Don’t worry. If I could, I would’ve already done it..

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.120
I know better than to mix work with personal matters.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.640
I never thought the Commisioner would send you to take care of me.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.800
How I’m glad to meet you again, Inspector.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.800
I’m sure we’ll meet again more often.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.200
My condolences to you and your team, Inspector.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.840
For losing your favourite assistant.
I’m really sorry that our country has lost another decent man.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.520
He died in the line of duty.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.160
I pray for all of them to rest in peace.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.360
They all lost their lives to serve the law.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.480
I also hope the law would be powerful enough to punish those who have done wrong.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.520
Yes. I too hope their sacrifices wouldn’t be a waste.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.360
Please excuse me, Inspector.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.160
Okay.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.280
Good evening, Mr. Montree.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.040
Have we ever met before? You look very familiar.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.840
Probably my father. He was also a police officer.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
You probably met my fathre before.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.920
Hmm, a police officer?

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.160
He was an inspector. He and my mother died...

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.560
after being framed in a car accident 10 years ago.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.680
Ladies and gentlemen, please come inside. The exhibition is about to start in 5 minutes.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.040
Well then, if you need any help, please let me know.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.000
Hey, didnt I tell you to calm down?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.600
Tharn, can I have a word with you?

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.880
Yes, sir.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.960
What is it, Inspector?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.360
Let me remind you again that our job today...

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.640
is to protect the safety of the VIP guests.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Yes, sir.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.120
I just didn’t expect that the VIP guests also include the Minister.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:17.080
Inspector knows, right? The story behind Mr. Montree and the drug trade.
Our job requires us to strictly follow the rules and code of conduct.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.040
He attends this event as a guest.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.640
Or have you found any evidence which points out that he is the suspect in this event?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.720
No, sir.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.800
Then just do your job.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.200
Yes, sir.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.080
Phaya, where are you going? The exhibhition is about to start.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.400
Where are you going?

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.160
Are you going to see your colleague?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.160
But today you’re here as a guest.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.240
Let them do their job.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.880
She’s right. The most important moment of the exhibition is about to start too.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.960
I heard that this is going to be the last solo exhibition of the artist.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.240
Really?

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.600
That’s a pity. This is going to be the last solo exhibition of Mr. Art Phakin too.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.080
No, that’s too evil.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.000
Ouch!

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.440
(Crying)

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.000
That man.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.360
Are you sure you don’t have it?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.200
Yes. I’m sure. My gallery has never purchased any of your artwork.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.080
Love has a great way to find you.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.320
It might push lovers...

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.920
to walk on a different path.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.640
But with undenying faith,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.760
love...

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.560
will always bring us together.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.560
(Screaming)

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.480
Bounded by...

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.520
destiny...

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.880
and burning flames of passion and yearning for each other.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.880
Love Eternity.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.800
Written by Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian writer.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.080
(Applause)

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:50.120
The Sign

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.160
Thank you for coming

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.520
Can I please have an autograph?

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.320
Sure

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.480
Here you go.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.160
Thank you

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.480
Thank you for coming

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.520
Finally, I get to meet you, Mr. Art.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.800
Mr. Montree.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.240
(Pushing someone off)

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.920
(Crying in pain)
Arghhh!

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.840
(Pushing someone off)

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.520
- Kao! / - Get out!

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.400
Kao! Where are you?!

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.160
Ouch!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.000
What did you do to him? Where did you take him?!

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.280
What the heck are you talking about?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.600
Where did you take Kao?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600
I don’t know.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.960
(Crying)
Liar!

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.960
Stop fooling yourself that he’s yours.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.600
He’s going to marry me

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.480
Stop fooling yourself!

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120
Fooling myself?

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.840
Fooling myself?

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.200
How dare you said that to me?
Who is it?

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.920
Who is it that’s actually fooling other people?!

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.000
Kao told me he went to see you that night.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.680
He went to tell you that he was going to marry me

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.760
We’re going to build a family together.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.480
(Crying)

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.040
(Crying)
I’m begging you. Can you please leave us alone?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.200
Can you get out of my life?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.800
What about my life?!

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.440
My life that you both have already ruined!

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.320
Who will pay for it?!

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.200
You will? What’s wrong with you?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.800
Do you think you’re the only one who is hurt?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.920
I want it too, a happy life and a family with the one I love.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.440
I want it too!

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.520
Go look for your boyfriend somewhere else.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.240
He’s not with me anymore

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.240
To me, a guy named Kao…

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.760
is already dead

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.000
- Ouch!!
- What did you do to him?!

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.240
Ouch!! Stop!!

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.800
- Stop!
- What did you do?!

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.280
I’m sorry

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.320
- Did you kill him?!
- Calm down.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.520
- Get off me!
- Stop!

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.800
Tell me!

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.440
Turn right and go straight for the exit.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.080
All is clear here.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.280
Okay.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.320
Can’t believe something like that would happen. So scary

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.600
Let’s not talk about it. The elders might worry about us.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.040
Okay.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.760
Every time when I saw Kao and Art together,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.840
I could tell that Kao really loved Art.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.640
I never knew he already has a girlfriend. How could he do this to Art?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.200
(Sigh)

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.040
Girls, you go and take Grandma back home first.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.400
I have to stay behind to help my colleagues.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.080
Phaya

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.720
Grandma, please go home first. Don’t worry about me.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.760
I think you should go with her

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.480
I’ll take care of it here

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.160
But then I’d worry about you

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.640
I’d rather stay

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.680
Then please take a good care of yourself. I’m worried.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.640
Please take care of him fo rme, Tharn.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760
Yes, Grandma

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.560
Come, let’s take her back home.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.480
- Grandma
- I’ll see you back home, Grandma

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.640
I already wrote down the names and contact numbers of all the guests

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.480
Mr. Art has already been taken to our unit.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.280
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.320
Okay.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.240
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.000
He said he’d only agree to give us an interview if we go to his place.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.080
Khem, you and Tongthai go interview him at his place tomorrow.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.480
Yes, sir.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.080
Can I go with them too?

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.880
No.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.800
You and Yai have to come back here to gather evidence tomorrow.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.920
And try to find more evidence at Art’s house too.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.080
Why do you want us to go to Art’s place?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.600
I suspect that he might have something to do with Kao’s disappearance

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.120
I’ll go with him

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.200
Why don’t you just go home?

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.360
I’d like to be put on this case too.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.280
Inspector

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.960
it seems like Mr. Art is losing his mind right now.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.480
Let's go.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.400
- Get off me! / - Stop!

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.000
Get off me!

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.160
- Get off me! / - Stop!

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.120
- Let me go! / - Stop!

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.160
- Get off me! / - Stop!

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.840
- No! / - Stop!

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.720
- No! / - Please calm down.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.440
No!!

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.560
Let me go!

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.760
Ouch!

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.080
Ouch!

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.600
Ouch!

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.040
Please let me help

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.200
The situation is in chaos right now

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.000
Better let us handle it

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.280
He used to be my patient

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.640
Please let me talk to him

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.520
Arghhh!. Ouch!

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.720
Mr. Art, please look at me

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.680
Everything that happened today...

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.600
you didn’t mean to make it happen

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.880
No, no. I didn’t

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.280
- You didn’t mean it
- No, I didn’t

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.000
- That’s right / - No.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.440
Please calm down and look at me, Mr. Art.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.040
You did not mean it.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.960
I was just an accident

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.320
(Crying)

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.080
Ouch!

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.000
(Crying)

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.840
It’s all right now, Mr. Art

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.720
(Crying)

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.840
Don’t be afraid

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.600
I will be right next to you

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.480
I’m sorry

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.760
No one is going to hurt you

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.760
I’m sorry

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.240
I promise

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.520
Please calm down

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.720
Calm down

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.240
Take him

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.360
Mr. Art used to come see me for a Hysteria treatment

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.600
He tried to involve art as a tool in line for his medical treatment

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.920
In the end, he informed us that...

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.800
he wanted to stop the treatment with us and tried to cure the sickness by himself.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:18.200
Being sick is not an excuse to be exempted from a punishment

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.160
No mental patient would ever want to tell everyone about their mental sickness.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.520
I think the reason he’s experiencing this disorder again...

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.200
is probably becauase he was aroused by something.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.040
So much that he could hardly control himself.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.640
You used to experience something like that too, didn’t you?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.720
Being unable to control yourself

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560
But in your case,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.480
I’m afraid it might not be because of the sickness.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.520
It’s more likely because of your traits...

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.600
and personality

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.040
Phaya.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.760
Thank you so much for your kind assistance, Doctor.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.360
My pleasure, Inspector.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.840
Please let me know if there’s anything I can do

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.640
That’d be all.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.240
I’m leaving then, Tharn

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.840
Okay

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.480
Tharn

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.800
Tharn

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.840
Can we talk?

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.280
What is it?

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.040
I called you so many times. Why didn’t you answer your phone?

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.320
I don’t have anything to talk to you

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.160
Hey, wait.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.040
Can you stop sulking and act like a grown-up?

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.440
Me? Sulking?

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.560
Fine. I’m sorry

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.440
I’m wrong. I’m an idiot

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.280
I’m sorry

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.000
Suit yourself

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.880
Listen to me

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.000
I’m like this because I’m too worried about you

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.560
I don’t know how to say it. Something makes me feel that...

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.719
you are going to leave me, Tharn

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.080
I just don’t feel good about it

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.159
I keep having more bad dreams

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.719
Hearing voices from the girl who looks so much like you.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.800
And all those things that the Abbot used to tell us.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.199
All those things make me feel that...

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.880
you and I have been bonded for a very long time

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.400
Now that something bad is about to happen to you

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.040
I have to do something otherwise I’d lose you

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:48.920
And I can’t bear to lose you, Tharn

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.880
Calm down

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.920
Hey, calm down

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.239
It’s going to be all right

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360
Easy there

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.600
You’re losing control of yourself

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.280
Just tell me you forgive me

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.640
And all these symptoms would probably go away

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640
Please forgive me

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.760
Yeah. Let’s get to work

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.800
(Sigh)

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.280
This is Mr. Art’s patient record

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.920
per your request, Inspector.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.800
Thank you

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.000
He has an anger management problem

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.880
He cannot deal with anxiety

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.320
And also has a problem in controlling his behaviours...

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.320
unlike normal people like us

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.520
So, what is the cause of this illness?

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.880
It depends, Inspector

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.520
Hysteria is caused...

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.600
mainly when patients feel that they are being neglected

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.120
The feeling might start to form since when they were still very young

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.880
Or when they have experienced a big disappointment

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.360
It can also occur due to the genetic problem

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.000
Or a lack of care and attention when they were being raised up

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.960
Patients with Hysteria tend to demand more love

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.280
and attention from people around them than usual

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.160
I see

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.640
Well,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.480
the reason I’ve asked you to come here today...

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.440
is because I’m going to interrogate Mr. Art

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.840
I’d like you to help observe his behavior

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.640
during the interrogation

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.560
To observe his mental condition

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.280
Whether he’s able to be interrogated

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.400
Or whether he has any unusal behaviour during the interrogation.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.200
That’d be my pleasure, Inspector

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.120
Thank you

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.520
Inspector, Mr. Montree urgently flew out of the country. He won’t be back for our interview until next week

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.400
From what I’ve investigated,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.600
it looks like Mr. Montree has bought a lot of Mr. Art work...

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.960
and also sent them abroad

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.720
The strange thing is...

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.760
Mr. Montree didn’t make a purchase with Mr. Art directly

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.720
He bought all the work from someone called Ning

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.240
She’s a girlfriend of Kao’s, the one who is missing right now

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.000
Montree probably sensed his danger and tried to run away

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.880
He’s definitely running away

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.120
I find the relationship between these two very strange

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.520
Ning and Art seem to hate each other

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.600
But why Ning is the person who sells Art’s work?

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.360
Have you found Kao?

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.880
Not yet.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.880
Then why did you call me here?

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.360
I have some questions to ask you.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.080
They are only for our references in this case.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.000
Do you know Mr. Montree?

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.200
Montree?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.520
Which Montree? I don’t know him.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.600
Mr. Montree whom you met at the exhibition yesterday.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.720
yesterday

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.560
I was only there to look for Kao.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.000
If you don’t know Mr. Montree,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.680
then how come there’s a record of you selling Mr. Art’s work to Mr. Montree through his secretary?

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.840
Miss Ning?

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.480
I already asked the bank to send me all transactions incurred on your bank accounts.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.640
A few months ago, there was a deposit of many hundred thousand baht in your account.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.360
I don’t know about that.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.360
I don’t know anything.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.840
Kao just took care of everything.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.280
He is the one who deals with Art

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.240
He asked me open an account under my name.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.200
He said he’d deposit some money in there...

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.400
for our wedding.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.840
(Crying)

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.520
Are you sure?

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.200
If you lied to us,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.360
it wouldn’t do you any good.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.680
I’m...I’m not lying.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.320
If you want to know anything,

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.920
you should go find Kao and ask him.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.080
You might get all the answers you’re looking for

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.880
Find him.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.160
(Shutter sound)

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.760
(Shutter sound)

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.840
(Shutter sound)

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.320
(Shutter sound)

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.480
I think Art and Kao...

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.200
aren’t just friends or colleagues.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.120
I found some clothes and personal belongings that might belong to Kao’s.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.320
So, what Ning said

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.920
about Kao and Art being together...

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.640
might be true.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.440
Yeah.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.400
And what the inspector has suspected about Art...

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.280
having something to do with Kao’s disappearance, might also be possible.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.280
Hey

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.600
Tharn.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280
What did you see?

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.840
I can feel something about this picture.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920
Hey.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.480
I think we’ve found a key evidence.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:55.640
We have done the lab test on Art’s DNA and the bloodstain that Phaya found at Art’s place,
the bloodstain doesn’t belong to Art.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.920
Whose is it?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:05.560
We don’t know yet.
But it matches with the dried bloodstain on the pen.
The one Art used to hurt Ning.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.280
From our interview with Ning,
she said Kao has disappeared 3 days ago.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.280
So, I asked Sing to track down Kao’s phone.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.480
The last place where he went...

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.920
is Art’s house.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.040
Here.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.080
This is the file from a CCTV camera in the alley where Art’s house is.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.280
Three days ago, Kao did go to see Art.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.560
This is not just a simple assault case.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.520
It might also be related to Kao’s disappearance.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.600
The traces of evidence, the bloodstain,

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.200
and the crime scene…

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.320
Everything that points out to what happened on that night.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.760
Where is Kao?

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.040
Only Art knows.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.320
Mr. Art.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.560
Do you recognize this pen?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.440
You used it to hurt Miss Ning.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.920
Did you also use to hurt anyone else?

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.280
I am talking to you, Mr. Art.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.440
Can you please cooperate?

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.000
Did you use this pen to hurt anyone else?

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.040
(Sad Music)

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.800
You don’t have to say anything.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.680
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.440
It’s all my fault.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.200
(Crying)

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.960
(Crying)

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.680
(Crying)

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.240
(Crying)

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.920
I’m sorry.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.800
I didn’t mean it.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.880
Kao.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.400
I’m not mad at you.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.120
From now on, we’ll be together.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.680
We’ll never part again.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.520
That night, he went to your house, didn’t he?

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.440
He wanted to break up with you because he was going to marry Miss Ning.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.920
We’ve already found...

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.600
a bloodstain of someone else’s on this pen...

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.200
other than that of Miss Ning’s.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.840
Did you kill Kao?

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.280
No.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.200
I didn’t do it.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.280
- You knew all along.
- I didn’t do it!

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.760
You knew, didn’t you?

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.760
That Kao secretly sold your work to Mr. Montree behind your back.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.680
That night, what did Mr. Montree whispered to you?

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.920
Did he threaten you?

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.880
Are you sure you’re not going to sell it to me?

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.680
Hmm, is this the pen that you used to hurt Kao?

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160
Love?

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.640
That’s sick.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.000
I didn’t do it.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.400
You were angry that Kao betrayed you.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.040
He used your love for money.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.560
He sold all the works you gave him.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.560
No.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.160
No.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.640
No, I didn’t do it.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.560
It was an accident.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.240
I didn’t do it.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.400
No.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.520
- Is Kao already dead?
- I’m sorry.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.200
I’m sorry.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.360
Can you stop calling me?
I’m trying to get everything done.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.880
That’s right.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.720
I don’t love him.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.160
I just want to use him.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.280
Is that what you want to hear?

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.520
Art, please let me explain.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.600

Get off me!

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.760
Art.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.760
Have you ever been honest with me?

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.720
Have you?
Just for once.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.840
Was that also true?

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.160
Or was it just another lie?.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.560
No, Art.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.560
I really love you.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.880
I do.
Love?

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.400
Please listen to me, Art.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.960
Please.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.960
Please calm down.
- No. / - Art.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.160
- Please listen to me. / - No.
- No! / - Please listen to me, Art.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.320
Ouch!

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.960
I thought I’d be able to give you a chance.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.920
I thought if you really loved me, I might be able to give you a chance.
But this is too much.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.400
I’m going to take back all my works.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.120
I’ll press charges...

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.880
against you and your girl.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.640

Art, listen to me.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.400
Get off me! Or I’ll kill you!

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.800

You have to pay for what you did.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.800
For all those lies.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.880
You have to pay.

(Crying while laughing)

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.600
Love?

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.280
There is no love.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.800
There’s only lies.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.160

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.360
Tharn, why do you think Art has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance?

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.600
Do you still remember when Art talked about love during the openining at the exhibition?

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.680
I think he said it because he missed him. He felt sad.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.160
He was yearning for someone he loved.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.600
I couldn’t feel any anger or hatred from him at all.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.880
Are you saying that...

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.760
Art still loves Kao?

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.520
There are many lovers who have to stay apart.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.280
I know that.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.600
But for me, if I love someone...

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.200
I’ll never let that person go.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.360
I’ll keep looking for him.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.840
And do everything that I can to make him stay with me.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.560
No matter what it takes.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.680

Can you stop calling me?

(Thunder Sound)
Don’t do that, Ning.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.840
I already told you.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.320
It’s all my fault.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.680
This has nothing to do with Art.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.240
That’s right.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.920
I didn’t love him.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.200
I just want to use him.

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.640
Is that what you want to hear?

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.600
I chose to be with you, to marry you.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.720
So, you should stop now.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.760

- You’re an asshole.

Get off me!

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.080
Get off me!

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.880
Art.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:37.440
Have you ever been honest with me?

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.240
Was that true? Or was it just another lie?

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.960
No, Art.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.000
I really love you.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.160
I do.
Love?

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.720
You call this, love?

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.360
I was blind to believe that you loved me.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.200
I thought despite you already having someone else...

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.640
despite how little you’d be able to share those love with me...

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.360
I thought it was still love. However little it was didn’t matter to me as long as you loved me.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.720
Please listen to me.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:12.920
No.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.160
Get off me.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.880

Please. Please.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.560

I thought I’d be able to give you a chance.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.960
I thought if you really loved me, I might be able to give you a chance.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.080
But this is too much.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.560

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:54.960

(Shutter Sound )

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.240
If this blood matches with the one on the pen,
then we’d know if Kao is still alive.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.120
Or whether Art has already killed him.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.160
Photo it.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.880

(Shutter Sound )

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.360
About the bloodstain that we found on the taxi

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.240
It matches with the one on the pen

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.120
Does it belong to Kao’s?

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.200
- Yes. / - Oh!!!

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.840
We have compared the DNA of bloodstain with those clothes and belongings Phaya had found at Art’s place.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.200
the DNA matches

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.960
It belongs to Kao’s.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.720
A camera on the taxi also showed that Kao called for a cab and took this taxi.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.720
But the driver said that Kao was on the phone

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.600
I’ll do everything exactly as I said

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.200
Then he got off in the middle of the road

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.160
Excuse me? Can you please turn right at this junction?

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.160
(Raining)

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.160
I asked Sing to check around that area. It’s an abandoned land with no residences nearby.

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.640
So, we had no idea where he went after that since there aren’t any CCTV camera around there.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.760
Oh, just in time. The inspector has called for a meeting.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.560
Okay

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.960
Wait.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.760
Can we release Art now?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.760
He doesn’t have anything to do with Kao’s disappearance anyway.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.320
Let the inspector decide

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.960
Let’s go for a meeting first

How serious is it?

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.960
It might escalate from one level to another

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.880
Oh, hello Doc

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.160
Doctor...

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.560
Can he be cured?

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.640
If so, how long will it take?

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.880
He has experienced a severe breakdown

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.880
I’m afraid it might take quite some time, Inspector

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.320
Is Mr. Art going to be in trouble because of Kao’s disappearance?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.640
Although he might not be involved with Kao’s disappearance,

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.960
he would still be charged with physical assault

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.440
If Mr. Art chose to walk away when he knew that Kao already had a girlfrirend,

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.440
this tragic incident wouldn’t have happened

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.560
Love is like that. You don’t always get what you want

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.720
But you’ve already fallen for someone,
it’s probably not that easy to give up on it.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.440
Even if it’s not easy,

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.120
but if it’s necessary, then you should do it

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Because what’s not ours will never be ours

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.520
There’s no use to keep being persistent
That’s right

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.320
No use at all.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.240
You better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.040
Walk away now so that you won’t waste your time

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.440
But if I really love someone,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.320
I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.040
And I’ll do everything...

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.960
to make the one I love stay by my side.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.960
Even if that person doesn’t love you?

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.760
Isn’t that too selfish?

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.520
Calm down, Phaya.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.280
I’m sorry, Inspector.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.960
I got a little carried away.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.800
Someone is trying to take away something dear to me

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:48.400
Well, lucky for me that I obey what the Abbot said and live my life by the Five Precepts.
That’s why my love life is so happy as it is.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:55.240
Kamesu-micchacara – one should abstain from a sexual misconduct.
And also, Musavata – to abstain from false speech

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.720
- Sathu. / - Sathu.
(Laughing)

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:09.240
(Thrill Sound)

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.480
Are you going home? Do you need a lift?

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.080
Don’t bother, Doctor.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.840
Tharn, we need to gather more information and find more evidence

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.680
It would take some time

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.040
So don’t let him wait

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.640
I’ll drop you off.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.400
Then you go ahead and head back home

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.480
I’ll go back with him

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.520
Did you hear that?

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.040
He will go back with me

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.960
So, don’t worry

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.560
I’ll see him to his bed

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.920
Thank you, Phaya

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:37.920
My pleasure

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.760
Let’s go

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.880
(Phone Ringing)

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.480
Yes, Doc?

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.000
[Chalothorn's voice: Hi Tharn, I'm at home now]

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.480
Okay.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.080
Please rest well.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.800
Does he really have to keep checking on you?

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.280
So annoying.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.200
Let’s talk about Art’s case tomorrow

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.880
I want to go home and get some rest

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.160
Let’s call it a day.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.360
Hey, wait

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.440
Huh? Do you really forget it?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.720
You said you will go back with me.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.440
I said that so that you two would stop fighting

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:43.520
Let’s go

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
- Hey. / - Come with me.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.640
No.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.160
Hey, I really want you to come with me

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.880
I have a surprise for you

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.880
What is it?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.720
It won’t be a surprise if I tell you

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.480
Please.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.280
(Oh yes!)

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.960
Hey, wait for me

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.280
Why did you take me to your home?

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.320
I just want you to come visit my place

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.960
I’ve already been to your place for so many times

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.320
Is this how you invite someone to your house?

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.640
Yeah.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.160
Oh, wow! Your house is so grand

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.840
Oh, hello. What’s your name?

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.680
It’s Namami.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.760
I see
(Meow)

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.720
Hello

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.760
Namami.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.400
No, I mean the cat’s name is Namami

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.240
I’m Paranee

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.600
(Laughing)
Ah, hello Paranee.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.160
Hello, Tharn.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.280
Is she your little sister?

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.760
No.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.000
My mother.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.960
Welcome to our house

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:33.480
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello.
You arrive just in time for dinner

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.480
Your family knows that I’d be coming?

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.480
Meow

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.600
How is it going with the case? Is everything all right now?

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.600
I’ve been watching the news about it. You guys are so great

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.600
- Right, Grandma?
- Yes.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.360
People are losing their minds more and more these days

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.080
In the old days when I watched the news,

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.240
I could still understand the reason why those people did something evil like that

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:11.360
They probably experienced something so terrible...
that caused them to act on impulse.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.240
But people these days are different. Their minds are beyond understanding.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:19.560
I totally agree with you, Grandma.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.920
They are nothing like Namami, right?
Namami...

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.200
Actually, it mostly revolves around only just one or two things

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.040
Being dishonest

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.760
or lying.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:40.080
And also a sexual misconduct driven by obsessions and desire.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.279
Wow!

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.960
You’re so cool. You know about all those things too.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.840
The Abbot taught me well.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.680
(Laughing)

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.960
Now that I’ve already invited him to our place

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.279
Are you going to let him stand here all night?

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:02.840
I’m so hungry, Grandma.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.279
Well, so am I.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.560
I’ve prepared something delicious for your friend

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.439
You, stay here. Don’t move.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.279
Tharn, let’s go and have dinner with me.
I’m so glad you finally came.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.880
I often heard Phaya

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.920
talking about you.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.160
Wait, not talking actually.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.240
He often dreamt about you.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.359
Let’s go. Don’t you dare move.

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:29.000
Come, let’s eat.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.640
- Leave him be.
- Okay.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.359
Serve you right. You’re no longer her favourite nephew

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.120
Namami, scratch her.
Let’s go eat, Namami.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.040
Hey, are you really going to leave me here?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.680
Fine, I’ll go there myself.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.120
I made

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.440
this myself.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.120
Oh, I was about to give you that.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.160
- Grandma. / - Yeah

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.840
- Tell me, has he ever done something funny to you?
- Huh?
(Laughing)

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.480
Wow, this is so good.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.480
I made it myself.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.080
(Lovely Sound)

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.520
Go on.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.720
I often come here to draw.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.600
I’ve been afraid of water since then.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.400
So, I tried to stay close to it – to get used to it.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.000
I’m trying too.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.280
(Eternity Remembrance Melody)

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.840
Tharn.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.680
Here.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.640
Ow!

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Do you remember...

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.520
the first time we met at the camp?

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.840
Do you know...

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.520
that I really wanted to hug you then?

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.000
Liar.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.840
You couldn’t even recognise me.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.160
But it was such a coincidence.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.320
But the end, wasn’t it me who took your hand and led you out of that place?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.040
Do you really think

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.800
all this is a coincidence?

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.480
Tharn.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.720
I like you a lot.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.640
I really do.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.960
I don’t know

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.560
why I’m like this too.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.800
But then I’ve come to realise about it.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.760
Even though I’ve just met you...

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.120
the closer I get to know you,

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.640
the more I feel that...

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.760
I’ll never be able to lose you.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.440
I really want to have you by my side in every day of my life.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.360
It’s as if...

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.040
I’ve felt like this for so long.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.640
Very long.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.560
I can’t love anyone, Phaya.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.040
If I love someone,

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.080
I’ll lose that person in the end.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.160
And I don’t want to lose you.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.520
I want to have you by my side.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.200
But this is the best I can do.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.800
Please don’t force me.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440
Because I really don’t want to lose you.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.880
Tharn.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.280
I’ll do everything to be with you.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.080
I’m not going anywhere.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.480
I’ll stay by your side.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.240
I’ll do whatever it takes so that you won’t be sad or lose me.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880
I promise.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.240
(Romantic Music)

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:41.760

(Thrill Sound)

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840

(Book flipping open)

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.920
Idolfactory

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.680
You and Phaya should be more careful during these days.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.320
The Abbot asked me to tell you...

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.280
to try to stay away from water.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.680
Tharn! Tharn!

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.080
(Thrill Sound)

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.280
(Praying)

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.520
Tharn! Wake up!

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.560
I'm so sorry.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.600
Tharn.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.080
Ouch!

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:58.560
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:24.800
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:44.040
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:51.840
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
