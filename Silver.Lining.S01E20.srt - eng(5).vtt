WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.050
Do we really have to do this?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240
What if Old K finds out?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.660
We can't worry about that now.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Actually,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.620
let's give her a little surprise.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.080
Hey,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.810
you're here.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.640
I came to buy some green beans.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.240
Sure.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520
These green beans look really good.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.840
Good.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:47.720
Chi Xia and I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.759
interviewed the school teachers

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.039
and neighbors in the area.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.000
We can now basically confirm

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.120
that Feng Yuqin

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.320
is a hardworking woman

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200
with limited education.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.360
I believe

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.920
even if she wanted to avenge Zhao Shengqian,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.960
she wouldn't have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200
the skills to commit such an elaborate locked-room murder.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.840
We originally suspected she might be manipulated by the Fox.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840
But now it seems

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.080
she's carrying the entire family burden alone,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.740
a woman with too many worries,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.680
making it unlikely she'd risk committing a crime.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.360
Wei,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.000
did you get the information

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.640
about the other rescuers

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.400
that I asked for the other day?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.000
It's ready,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.520
with Officer Xia.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.079
Do you want it?

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:24.880
Just a moment.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.680
Wang,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.010
Officer Wei is here.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.320
That woman who often comes with her child,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.880
you know her, right?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.760
Yes, I do.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560
Take this,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.280
here.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
When she comes again,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.840
take good care of her.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.960
Pick the freshest vegetables for her.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.280
If there's not enough, take it from this money.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.720
Alright,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.579
I'll definitely take care of her.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.000
At that time, the rescue team

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.960
had seven people

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.240
besides Zhao Shengqian.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.520
After that blind girl Qu Feiyu

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.040
left because of her blindness,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.800
the rescue team disbanded shortly after.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.080
Two of them joined

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080
a new rescue team.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080
The remaining four people

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.320
also shifted their focus to new

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.680
careers and families.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.000
However, these people

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640
still maintain contact with Feng Yuqin,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.880
often visit her,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.240
and help her out when needed.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.920
If we're excluding Qu Feiyu,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920
that's not right.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.240
We can't rule her out now.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.000
Look,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.810
after Zhao Shengqian died,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.680
Qu Feiyu's financial support

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.120
to Feng Yuqin

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240
was actually much more frequent than others.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.120
But unlike the other six people,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.120
she was both a witness

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.200
and a victim.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.920
This indicates that for the past five years,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.120
she's been dwelling on

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.450
that rescue operation.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.930
It's too early to rule her out as a suspect.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.000
Check it thoroughly.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
What do you think?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.730
Chief Chang.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.140
I request to assist with the investigation.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.920
I need information about someone named Qu Feiyu,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.760
her entry records in other countries,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.890
to confirm her detailed whereabouts.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.480
Okay.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.720
I'll send you her identity information now.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.680
Take this.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.480
Alright.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.050
All these years,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.279
this small association of mine

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.079
has relied on Mr. Qu's support.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.200
I never expected that a businessman like you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.280
would have such a strong sense of social responsibility.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.880
I truly admire you.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.770
Let me toast you with tea

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.330
instead of wine.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.880
About what I mentioned earlier,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.610
I wonder if President Sun has made a decision yet?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.920
Well...

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.440
This murder case at Bailong Resort

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.240
has caused quite a stir.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.960
Everyone in Yuji Town

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.480
has heard about it to some extent.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.920
And it also involves

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.640
the former rescue team captain Zhao Shengqian.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.520
If our association were to

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.520
stick our nose

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.720
into this matter now,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.600
I'm afraid

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.440
it would damage our reputation.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.380
I'll give you two options.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.440
Either

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.520
you do as I say,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.360
and I'll increase my sponsorship to your association.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.160
Or

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.400
I'll withdraw my previous sponsorship

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.920
and cut off your funding.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.240
No,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.080
Mr. Qu,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.610
we can't lose that funding,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.080
we really can't.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.000
I...

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.440
I was just

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.480
trying to discuss this with you.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.159
Come,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.320
Mr. Qu,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.200
everything is negotiable.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.330
We can work this out.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.760
Luo,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
come look at this.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.240
January 16.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.970
That's tomorrow, isn't it?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.720
At this moment,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.080
this association suddenly changed its tune.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.880
What are they up to?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.680
What are they planning?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.160
We'll find out tomorrow.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.960
Mr. Zhao Shengqian.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.000
He has always been recognized by our Civil Search and Rescue Association

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.460
as the most outstanding rescue team leader.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.080
Due to some oversight in previous work,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.480
Captain Zhao has been stigmatized for a long time.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.440
So today,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.620
the Association is willing to bravely step forward

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.080
and admit our mistakes.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.280
To Captain Zhao's family,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.720
we express our most sincere apologies.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.400
Today we are here

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.159
not only to restore Captain Zhao's reputation,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.200
but also

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.640
to make amends.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.120
We will pay all the overdue compensation

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.320
and living allowances for these years

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.840
to Captain Zhao's wife,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.640
Mrs. Feng.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.520
Please welcome Mrs. Feng and her child to the stage.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.560
I never thought

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.170
he would have a chance to restore his reputation.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.880
Although it's a bit late,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
I still

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.880
thank you all.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.120
Speaking of gratitude,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.280
we would like to thank Mr. Qu for being here today.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.100
This award ceremony today

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.050
wouldn't be possible without Mr. Qu's sponsorship.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.680
In the future, our rescue team's equipment

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.360
will become more professional.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.240
The safety of our rescue personnel

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.760
and their quality of life

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.080
will also be well guaranteed.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040
I believe

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.800
our Civil Rescue Association

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.880
will certainly live up to its mission.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.480
We will make greater contributions

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.140
to the development of Yuji's tourism industry.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.760
Yuji Rescue Team

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.960
I didn't expect you all to be here too.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.160
How else would we know you helped us so much?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.000
It's nothing.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.560
Alright.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.840
Stop pretending.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.040
Going for that 'do good deeds anonymously' routine, huh?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.600
Yes.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.120
I was hard on you before,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.880
but I think you did a really good job with this.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.840
When the case is over,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.970
I'll buy you a drink.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.320
Me?

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.320
I'm just doing my civic duty.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.799
Using the appropriate sense of social responsibility

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.720
to improve my personal and company image.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.960
Thanking me so much

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.480
is a bit over the top, isn't it?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.240
Not at all.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.410
Should I give you a banner of honor too?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.360
Okay,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.240
no more joking.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.960
I have some executives waiting for me over there.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.720
I need to go.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.650
You all carry on.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.440
Sure.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.560
Bye.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.920
Chief Chang

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.360
Luo Xun, listen to me.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.720
That information you asked me to check

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.080
about Qu Feiyu's immigration records

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.120
I found it.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.000
She hasn't left the country in three months.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.800
There's absolutely no record

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.600
of her entering any foreign country.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.760
No immigration records?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.520
Right.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.320
How are things going for you guys in Yuji?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:25.840
Luo Xun?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.320
Oh.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.960
It's going okay.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.960
Chief Chang, I'll talk to you later.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.040
Based on Fox's usual methods,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.680
if she could manipulate an elderly person like Zheng Lanshu,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.800
helping a blind person

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.330
commit murder for revenge isn't impossible.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.700
But how did she manage to do it?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.800
Luo.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680
Come look at this.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.520
Is that a wire?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.200
Be careful.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.240
It's fine.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.890
Did you find something?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.400
It's new.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.360
Must have been installed recently.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.560
I suspect

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.380
this Buddha head was once suspended.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.900
The Mountain God statue has protected Yuji Town residents for generations.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.880
Without the Yuji Town residents,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.480
outsiders can never leave Dead Man's Mountain.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.000
Why?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.360
We could have all left together.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.520
Why did you do this?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.960
Why?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.160
Luo Xun.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.840
If you had experienced what I have,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.480
what form of redemption would you choose?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.000
Captain Luo.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.800
Usually when people are in an enclosed space,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.760
in darkness,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.000
and panicking,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.280
where do they hide?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.850
They look for cover.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.400
Victims instinctively flee from

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.520
the source of their fear.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.920
Like a tape recorder making strange noises,

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.600
a fallen Buddha statue,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.320
or Xiong Jing's body hidden in the wall.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.680
To feel safe,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.940
they could only go to that relatively enclosed small room.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.480
All the evidence now proves

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.580
that this locked-room murder

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.760
is closely related to Zhao Shengqian's

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.560
mountaineering team from back then.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.320
But with so many people involved,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.520
which one could it be?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.520
I saw a post on a forum earlier.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.980
The title was exactly about this.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.680
But according to the poster,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.200
the only person connected to the mountaineering case

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.160
is Qu Feiyu.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.560
Qu Feiyu?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.080
A blind person.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.160
To execute such a complex murder,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.720
she couldn't have done it alone.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.920
Who could it be?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.660
Look at these Buddha statues.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.280
Twelve of them.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.760
Such a familiar number.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.090
Who else could it be?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.020
The Fox, of course.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.080
Chi Xia.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.400
Didn't you ask me to monitor

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.000
Xiong Jing's social media?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.200
On victim Xiong Jing's social media account,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.480
a video from 5 years ago was suddenly posted.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.000
It shows footage she recorded of Shi Guangxuan,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.720
Yao Lixing,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.160
leading the group stealing food from Zhao Shengqian and

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.480
Qu Feiyu.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.080
Look at the public opinion.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.080
It's completely out of control now.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.240
Move aside.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.720
Mr. De.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.360
We're just following orders.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.880
Please don't make this difficult.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.120
If we break the rules,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.650
it won't be good for anyone.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.720
If we don't complete this,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.200
we won't dare go back.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.440
Come.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.400
Come.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.960
Who made these rules you're talking about?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.660
What's wrong? Don't move.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.450
- Smoke.
- Smoke.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.890
- Smoke.
- Smoke.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.320
Give your boss a message.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.680
One of these days,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.520
I'll pay him a visit personally.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.080
I've smoked the cigarette.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.800
Is that good enough?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.760
Get lost.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.760
The forensic results are out.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.160
The video was scheduled to be sent.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.240
The video's backend shows

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.760
that its operation time

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.840
matches Xiong Jing's time of death.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.000
We can basically confirm

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.400
it was done by the killer.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.080
The video was sent

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.520
at 18:25.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.600
Usually, scheduled times

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.800
are set either at half past

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.080
or on the hour.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.720
Setting it at 25 minutes

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.920
is quite unusual.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040
Plus, this number 25

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.280
has appeared for the fourth time now, right?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.800
At first, internet users were completely confused.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.160
But some comments were too leading.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.840
Now people have dug up

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.040
the whole story behind the rescue team.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.340
I guess this was the killer's intention.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.160
To clear Zhao Shengqian's name.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.280
What's wrong?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.280
There's been an incident at the guesthouse.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.520
A group of people just tried to sneak into the hostel.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.780
But strangely enough,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800
they were stopped by another group.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.850
The target is Tu Guolin.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.760
It must be him.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.680
Captain Luo.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.360
Should we check the nearby surveillance cameras?

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.800
No need.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.320
It's dark,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.120
they're wearing masks.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.880
I've asked Heizi to keep watching.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.680
I just talked with Jue,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.010
we think that video was sent by the killer.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.240
And the time it was posted

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.560
was 18:25.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.080
25 has appeared again.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.840
Indeed it has.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.480
With all this commotion now,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.040
Qu Feiyu definitely won't dare to go

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.440
to Zhao Shengqian's home for the memorial service again.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.120
Look,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.520
these are all the hotels,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.320
inns,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.960
and guesthouses in Yuji with their exact locations.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.040
I've had Xiao Wei mark them all.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.760
She's been deliberately concealing her itinerary before,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.040
she won't leave any accommodation information.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.800
That's why

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.520
we're choosing to act at night.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.320
I've asked Xiao Wei

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.000
to gather all the police officers.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.200
We'll split up

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.020
and check each room one by one.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.000
This area,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.260
you take care of it.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.120
This area,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.640
I'll handle it.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.240
Alright,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.460
you're so experienced, Captain Luo.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.370
As long as Qu Feiyu is still in Yuji,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.170
don't expect to get a good night's sleep tonight.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.520
Comrade.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.400
When you're delivering packages,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.130
have you ever seen this person?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.480
This person?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.839
I think I've delivered packages to her before.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.839
Is she blind?

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:06.240
Yes.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.000
Where is she?

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.079
I think her home is in...

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.200
Is it reliable?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.920
Wei.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.240
Absolutely reliable.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240
This is an illegal hostel.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240
They only find customers online.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.000
That's why last night,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.240
we missed it during our search.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.800
I've already had people secure both the front and back doors.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.240
How did you find it?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.120
I thought since Qu Feiyu is blind,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.520
and Yuji is a small town,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.640
if she went out,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.000
she would definitely attract attention.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.080
So I specifically looked for people

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.200
who move around the streets and asked them.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.000
Surprisingly, I actually got information.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.120
Well done.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.080
But we've been watching for a while now,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.800
and haven't seen any signs of her going out,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.840
nor have we spotted any suspicious individuals.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.100
So we don't know exactly what's going on.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.200
Blind people are generally more sensitive to sounds.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.000
You were right not to alert them.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.400
But we still can't rule out

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.120
the possibility that the hostel owner

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.640
is harboring Qu Feiyu.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.680
So before we find her exact location,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.210
it's better to be cautious.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.570
We're almost there.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.060
Don't talk.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.250
So this is your illegal business, huh?

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:17.920
Listen,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.800
we'll deal with your situation later.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.480
Right now,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.440
cooperate with our investigation.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.500
We ask, you answer.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.800
This person,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560
have you seen her?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.800
Is she staying here?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.680
Yes,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.600
she's blind, right?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.080
Yes.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.640
Where is she?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.440
Which room?

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.080
Second floor.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.240
Where on the second floor?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.040
The balcony on the second floor.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.010
You're Qu Feiyu, right?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.250
We're police officers.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.120
There's a case

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.980
we'd like you to cooperate with our investigation.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.080
You've finally come.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.760
Without the help of us Yuji Town residents,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.890
none of you will make it out of this Death Mountain alive.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.600
We are guilty.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.320
You deliberately carved this on the victims, didn't you?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.200
They are unforgivable.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.720
Kill me.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.400
You fake fox,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.520
you'll never become real.
