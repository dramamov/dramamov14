00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.600
Let’s finish your work.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600
I know you’ve always wanted to do it.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.840
Hello, Mr. Montree.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320
I finally get to meet you, Mr. Art.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120
- What did you do to Kao? What did you do?
- Stop.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.560
You didn’t mean it.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.880
I didn’t do it.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.040
He’s not the culprit.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.880
Found the bloodstain.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.760
Can we release Art?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.880
He has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.280
No use to keep being persistent.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.400
Better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.440
But if I really love someone, I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.360
Tharn, I’m going to do everything to have you by my side.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.479
Please stop.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.560
If you keep doing this, your soul will be destroyed one day.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.040
He messes with what is mine.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.800
He has to die!

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.240
Nothing ever belongs to you, you are well aware of that.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.840
Tharn didn’t choose you.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.880
The worst sin in life is to think only about oneself.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.200
This love full of selfishness that you’re trying hold on to...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.680
will eventually burn you to hell.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.520
I don’t care.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640
I will never let them be together.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.200
Tharn has to be with me, and I will make them parted for eternity.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120
Tharn, wake up.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
Tharn.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.440
Wake up.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.200
Phaya!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480
Hey!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.640
What happened?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.200
Are you okay?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.840
Yeah.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720
Did you have a bad dream again?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.480
Yeah.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.440
In that dream, someone was trying to strangle me.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.680
It was so real.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.680
I think you should wear this necklace while you sleep.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.440
Okay.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.520
I’m all right now. Let’s go back to sleep.

The Sign

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.640
What you saw isn’t a dream.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.680
It’s your karma.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.120
What I saw in the dream is acutally my karma?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.400
Tharn, that doctor you’re getting a treatment from…

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.240
Better keep these two people away from each other.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.440
Don’t let them meet.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.000
Hello, Luangpor.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.040
Tharn.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200
I need your advice on something.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.360
Okay.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.520
Wake up, Tharn.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.200
It wasn’t just your voice that I heard.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.640
I also heard someone else’s voice.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.480
That person was screaming in pain.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.200
The voice sounded so familiar.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.680
Bounded by a chain of karma and the ego that knows no end,
he is coming back to reclaim what once belonged to him.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.080
What do you mean by that?

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.920
Tharn, you and Phaya must be more careful during these days.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.520
Always be mindful. The danger can occur in any moment.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.960
What danger, Luangpor?

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.520
You both will face a serious problem.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.960
Stay mindful and use your wisdom.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.720
Remember, your good deeds and merits will always protect you.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.880
Also, try to stay away from the river.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.880
Because it’s where he lives.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.640
Yes, Luangpor.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.080
[Phaya: I already put your clothes in a washer.]

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.800
[Phaya: You can wear my clothes to work today.]

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.120
[Phaya: Hurry up and get dressed then come down for breakfast.]

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.320
Hey.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.560
Does it fit? I think it’s a little too big.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.360
It’s okay.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.880
I made you a sandwich. Try it.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.160
Go on. I want to know if you like it or not.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.480
Where is your Grandma?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
I want to say goodbye to her before we go to work.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.200
My sister took her to see a friend.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.360
Do you want sugar?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200
I’ll have two of that.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.800
Two?

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.200
Hmm

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.120
Why did you kiss me?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.840
Well, you said you wanted two of that.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.160
So, I just gave you my sweetest kisses. Do you want more?

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.400
Quit it. I meant the sugar.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.400
If you keep eating like that, you’ll get diabetes soon.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.360
Better have my sweet kiss instead. It’s good for your health.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.480
Whatever, I don’t want it anymore.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.400
Aww

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.400
By the way, I just talked to the Abbot.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.640
I told him about your bad dream.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
He asked me to warn you...

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.360
to try to stay away from the river.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.640
But can I stay close to you then?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.760
Quit fooling around. I’m being serious.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.040
It might have something to do with why you had a bad dream last night.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.840
But it’s just a dream after all. Don’t worry too much.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.400
Or maybe, it might be because I decided to be with you.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.360
Hey, stop that. It’s totally unrelated.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.000
I already told you, haven’t I? That I’ll always be by your side.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.360
Well, if you’re that worried,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.920
why don’t you move in with me so that we can be together all the time?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.160
Wanna do that?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.840
No.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.080
I’ll let you say it again.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.680
No.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.760
But my bed is so soft. You had already tried it last night.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.520
Ouch.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680
What are you doing?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.400
It’s a mess now.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.440
Hurry up and finish your breakfast so that we can go to work.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.120
I know that.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.400
Stop smiling like a fool.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.040
(Boxing)

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.600
Wooo

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
(Boxing)

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.720
Wooo

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.040
Hmmmm

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.320
Just give up, Babe.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.120
You can’t beat me.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.520
If you don’t let me win, then let’s break up.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.680
Oh...

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.560
I lost.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.080
Not like this. Get up.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.480
(Laughing)

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.680
Ouch!

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.480
- You won.
- Hey.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.760
There you are. Why didn’t you pick up my call?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.320
Why didn’t you pick up my call last night?

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.920
Are you working today?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.040
I thought you’d take a day off.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.520
Hewwww

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.920
I’m not sick. Why should I take a day off?

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.840
Well, I thought you’d go on a honeymoon...

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.760
since last night...

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200
you slept at Phaya’s place, didn’t you?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.840
Hey!

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.160
That’s right.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.400
How did you know?

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.640
I had dinner around your flat last night. I wanted to drop by your place to give you some snacks...

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.200
but you didn’t pick up my call.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.680
I went to your room and rang the bell but no one answered it.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.360
So, I figured out you might not be home.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.640
And then I saw you two coming to work together.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.960
It was so obvious.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.080
Yeah.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.080
You’re also wearing an oversized shrit.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.960
It must be Phaya’s.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.000
Hooo

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.720
It’s pretty obvious. Just admit it.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.400
Come on. Just say it.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.520
From what I’ve analysed,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.840
our suspect seems to be lying. He tries to avoid our gaze and is also stuttering.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.600
(Laughing)

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.680
- Yeah, stuttering indeed.
- Ouch.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.160
- Stuttering, you said?
- Ouch.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.960
Stuttering my arse.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.960
Babe, help me. I was just making fun of him a bit.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.440
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.200
That’s enough.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.800
Yes, he slept at my place.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.320
My grandma and my sister wanted to thank him and treat him for dinner.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.920
Thank him for what?

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.360
For loving me...

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.040
For every time that you hug me...

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.160
- Hug you?
- Ouch.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.080
Babe, help me.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.040
Help!

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.360
Give it to me.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.320
Here, let me help.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:02.560
- I’ll help you.
- Ouch.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.160
I’m glad to see you smile like that again.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.319
And to have someone by your side.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.599
Phaya.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.760
What?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.400
Take care of my bro for me.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.040
Me too.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.040
You too, what?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.200
Please take care of my body too.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.480
Your body? Okay.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.680
Come, Tongthai.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.920
- Your body?
- Ouch.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.320
- One more.
- Ouch.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.760
Make it two.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.840
- Two more?
- Okay.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840
You got it.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.240
Ouch! Ouch!

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.480
Hey, guys!

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.120
Hey!

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.480
Inspector has called for a meeting about Kao’s case.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.880
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.000
This morning, the bank called to confirm they had detected a new transaction on Kao’s credit card.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.680
But the person who used it isn’t Kao.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.800
It’s a teenage boy who is around 20 years old.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.920
He told us he went there to find some fish.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.560
And found Kao’s wallet in the swamp.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.240
Where’s this swamp?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.680
6km away from where Kao got off the taxi.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.280
We’ve checked via the satelltie.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.120
It’s a deserted forest with no residences nearby.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.120
Just a forest and the swamp where the wallet was found.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.000
What was Kao doing there?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.760
Phaya, Tharn, and Yai. Go find more evidence at the swamp.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.000
Tongthai and Kem, go to Ning’s place.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.760
Make her talk more about Kao.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.680
Ask her if Kao has any sibling or relative that he can rely on.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.080
Someone he really trusts that he can stay with them.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.360
Yes, sir.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.240
Found anything?

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.320
Not yet.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.280
We haven’t seen any residence in this area.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.080
Why would Kao come here?

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.600
Or did he come here to meet that person he was talking to on the phone?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.800
The taxi driver also said that Kao asked to get off after he hung up.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.920
At a place like this? It’s probably not something good.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.240
Let’s split up and look around the swamp.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.360
We might get more evidence from there.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360
Okay.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.840
I tried to interview those people but still didn’t get anything new.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.120
Phaya! Phaya!

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.520
Tharn, what’s wrong?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.080
You’d better get out of here.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.520
Why?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.280
Don’t you remember what the Abbot has warned you?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.640
That you should stay away from the river.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.000
Go and wait outside.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.520
Yai and I will take care of it here.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.280
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.920
I’ll be fine. You’re here with me.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.960
You’ve seen a lot of visions where I was supposed to be dead.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.240
But I’m still alive.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.400
I trust you that you’d be able to take care of me.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.800
And I want you to trust me too.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.800
So what?

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.880
I’m not leaving you.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.000
Promise me...

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.480
that you won’t go anywhere.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.000
Okay.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.240
Now, I wish my wife were a cop too.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.440
So that I would get some romantic scene like this.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.480
(Shutter sound)

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.080
(Coughing)

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.840
Oh, that one was mine.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.480
I’m sorry.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.120
The tide is quite stable now.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.320
Let’s have the divers go look under the water again.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.720
Yes, sir.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.920
Where should we start?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.520
(Incoming call)

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.640
Hi, Doc.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.840
Oh, I’m working.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.280
Hello?

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.960
Hello? The signal isn’t quite good here.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.240
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.280
Yes.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.560
I went there to discuss about the case.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.640
It was quite late so I just slept there.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.640
That’s good.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.800
Let’s start.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.680
Okay.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.400
Yes.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.840
Divers, please get ready.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.840
เฮ้ย

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.800
I’ll go see you after my work is done.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.040
I have something to talk to you.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.880
See you.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.040
That way.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.360
Come quick!

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.600
Tharn!

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.400
Tharn! Where are you?

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.360
Tharn!

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.760
Tharn!

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.240
Tharn!

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.960
What’s he doing?

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.880
Tharn!

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Tharn!

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.600
Tharn! Tharn!

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.480
Tharn! Tharn!

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.920
Tharn! What are you doing?

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.920
I’m glad we meet again.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
Who are you?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480
Where is this place?

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.920
How did I get here?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.160
You were here before.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.800
Don’t you remember?

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.200
I was here?

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.840
I have been waiting for so long to meet you.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.160
To make amends to what I have done wrong to you...

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.800
and Wansarut.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.600
Do you know Wansarut?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.560
She is my younger sister.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.920
And also your lover.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.280
Today, you will know all the truth about your past.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.120
Master Garuda.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.680
Garuda?

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.720
Argh!

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.120
Why does it hurt so much?!

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.120
Arghh!
You’re being constricted by the Naga like that Garuda.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.600
Arghhh!
You can also feel his pain...

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.880
because you and that Garuda...

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.480
is one and the same.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.240
(Crying in pain)
Arghh!

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.120
That damn doctor.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.200
He is Prince Chalothorn.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.480
The ruler of Naga city.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.160
And also your enemy of love.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:50.880
You were injured from your fight with Chalothorn and then you met my sister.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.800
Ouch!

00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.960
Ouch!

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.040
Ouch!

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.600
Ouch!

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.240
That's my sister Wansarut.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.080
My sister felt sorry for you

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.240
so she brought you to her place in secret so that she could treat you.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.880
Why did you help me?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.800
Because you were still alive.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.960
Once you’ve regained your strength,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.640
get out of this place as soon as you can.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.200
Ouch!

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.560
Don’t touch me!

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.840
Thank you.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.520
I will repay you when I can.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.680
Can you repay it now?

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.720
What do you want?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.320
Can you and your kind stop hunting us?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.840
Can’t we just live our separate lives?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.480
Ouch!

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.800
If Chalothorn hadn’t attacked us first,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.720
then we wouldn’t have to hurt you and your kind.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.920
I don’t want to argue with you.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.920
Get well soon.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.160
And leave.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.680
Ouch!

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.920
Is this the cause of vengeance between the Naga and the Garuda?

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.640
In the past, Naga and Garuda were siblings.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.920
But due to a serious controversy and also jealousy, it escalated into a war between bloodlines.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.280
I haven’t visited the human world for quite some time.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.160
Have you come down to visit here lately?

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.360
The human world?

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.600
Long before I was born,

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.880
there was a legend told about a Naga...

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.320
who disguised itself as a man in order to become a monk.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.240
One night while that Naga was asleep and revealed its true self,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.720
the Buddha asked it to leave the monkhood…

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.880
since it was not a human creature and couldn’t be ordained to become a monk.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.280
Later on, when the Buddha came down from the second heaven where Indra dwells...

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.800
after visiting his mother for one whole season,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.200
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants…

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.560
had brought their offerings and breathed out fire to pay respect to the Buddha...

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.200
on his return to the human world on the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.760
There...look at that.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.920
Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.560
Yes.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.680
So beautiful.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.719
But in the end,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.560
everything was ruined because of me.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.360
Because of my jealousy...

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.679
for wanting Master Chalothorn for my own.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.360
So, I set up a plan...

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.120
and made it look like Wansarut was poisoned to death.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.360
Then I would take her to you.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.040
But then...

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.320
nothing ever escaped the eyes and ears of Master Chalothorn.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.639
You tried to take Wansarut away.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.880
But you were caught by Chalothorn.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.840
Wansarut! Wansarut! Where are you?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.920
Wansarut!

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.480
Wansarut! Where are you?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.880
Wansarut!

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.240
Wansarut!

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.560
Wansarut!

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.040
Where are you?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.120
Wansarut!

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.440
Wansarut!

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.760
Wansarut!

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.640
Master Garuda, what are you doing here?

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.120
You would be in danger if you are seen.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.920
I’m worried about you. Where have you been?

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.800
This is my home.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.520
Do not worry about me.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.760
Please go.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.760
No.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.240
You have to come with me.
You can’t be here.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.320
I can’t go with you.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.480
Can’t you see...

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.120
what a war caused by your brother has destroyed?

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.040
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.080
No, you have to come with me.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.560
You can’t be here.
Please go back.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.440
Nobody is going anywhere.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.640
(Fighting)

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.800
(Fighting)

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320
(Fighting)

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.680
(Fighting)

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.200
Stop it!

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.280
Ouch!

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.120
Please stop, Master Chalothorn.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.080
(Fighting)

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.240
(Fighting)

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.680
Stop!

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080
Master Chalothorn.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.320
I will stay with you.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.520
Please let Master Garuda go.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.800
I’m not going anywhere.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.440
No...don’t do that.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.400
Master Chalothorn.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.640
Return Nagini to me!

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.200
No.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.760
She is mine.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.240
You should let her go.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.560
She doesn’t love you.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.080
I don’t care. Whether she loves me or not, she must stay with me.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.800
Not with someone like you.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.040
You are Nagini.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.320
Garuda and Nagini can’t be together.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.440
What we have between Wansarut and I...

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.800
is pure love and affection.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.680
Why do we have to create a condition or boundary for our love?

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.120
Love has no right or wrong.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.440
I will prove to you...

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.000
that a Garuda like me...

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.520
can also love Wansarut.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.440
(Fighting)

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.520
Wansarut!

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.160
No!

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.800
No!

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.360
Wansarut!

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.040
Wansarut!

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.600
Wansarut!

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.520
Sorry...

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.520
I’m sorry.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.600
Garuda,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.000
I might not be able to be with you in this life.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.000
But in my other next lives,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.360
I only wish to be right next to you.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.760
And I will always take care of you.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.680
I promise you.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.760
If our next lives do exist,

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.640
I will keep looking for you...

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.720
until my last breath.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.080
Arrrrrh

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.960
Arrrrrh

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.200
Wansarut!

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.400
Wansarut felt so guilty for being the cause of your death.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.880
So, she decided to cough out her own soul…

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.120
to save your life.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.240
But she was so weak.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.680
And wasn’t able to help you.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.280
Still, she had made a wish before losing her last breath.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.000
What does all this have to do with me?

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.240
I didn’t take Wansarut from Chalotorn.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.080
I didn’t even know your sister.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.080
No matter how many lives have passed, you and my sister will always find each other.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.960
Even now, you and my sister are still in love with each other.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.080
I don’t love your sister anymore.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.000
I already have someone else that I love.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.240
His name is Tharn.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.120
That Wansarut you used to love...

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.480
is Tharn.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.680
You and Wansarut are destined to meet in every life…

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.160
but never be able to be together...

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.320
because Master Chalothorn will always be there to obstruct you.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.040
And kill you.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.720
But he’s also unable to do so because you have the soul of Naga with you.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.440
The one that my sister gave you.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.880
The soul of Naga?

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.600
It’s that necklace Wansarut gave you.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.800
Never remove it.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.120
(Wind sound)

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.280
Master Chalothorn must have known already...

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.280
that I am here to see you.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.920
And tell you everything.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:34.000
On this 15th night of the 11th waxing moon, you must protect my sister.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.680
Do not let Master Chalothorn take her away.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.160
Otherwise you and my sister...

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.360
will be parted...forever.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.800
Wait! Wanwisa! Wait!

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.400
Wait!

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.520
Ouch!

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.960
Ouch!

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.960
It’s really Kao

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.680
Judging from his body,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.760
he must be killed somewhere else and dumped here.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.800
[Phaya: Lieut Tam didn’t tie this knot on his ankles by himself.]

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.880
The knot is at the back. This means someone tied it for him.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.680
That’s right.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.120
Excuse me?

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.320
Tharn.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.160
The knot on his ankles...

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.160
looks exactly like the one on Lieut Tam’s body.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.600
These two cases must be related.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.600
(Raining)

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.600
Ouch!

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.640
Help! Help!

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.520
Hey!

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.800
I’d like to inform IDF unit...

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.400
that we’ve found Kao’s body.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.520
Hey!

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.640
Stop!

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480
Hey!

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.840
Stop!

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.000
Put your hands up!

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.520
Turn around slowly.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.440
(Gunshot)

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.400
(Gunshot)

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.800
(Gunshot)

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.240
(Gunshot)

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.400
(Fighting)

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.200
(Gunshot)

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.600
(Fighting)

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.440
Hey!

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.680
Stop!

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.120
(Gasping for air)

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.560
Are you all right?

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.120
Follow him!

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.480
Ouch!

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.160
Phaya!

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.800
Phaya!

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.600
Phaya!

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.160
Phaya!

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.040
Phaya!

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.480
Phaya!

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.440
Help!

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.240
Help!

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.760
Anybody, please help!

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.560
Help!

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.880
Phaya!

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.800
Anybody, please help!

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.440
Idolfactory

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.560
Phaya, please stay with me.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.080
Pipop!

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.160
Um

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.160
Are you saying that Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.960
Our suspect tried to fight back

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.880
(Fighting)

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.600
So, I got a glimpse of the tattoo on his arm.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.640
If you want me to believe you,

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.840
show me an evidence.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.560
I’ll let you choose whether you’d take us with you,

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.880
or I’ll tell the Inspector.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.680
If you can’t separate work from your personal matters,

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:48.760
🎵Things made me realize🎵

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:57.520
🎵That the love we had made you leave🎵

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:04.080
🎵I didn't want it to be this way🎵

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:13.160
🎵Because I have a heart, that is kept only for you🎵

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:26.920
🎵I don't want that, so what should I do?🎵

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.240
🎵Or should I just disappear?🎵

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:44.120
🎵From now on, there's no one left to have to stay and watch you walk away🎵

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:53.320
🎵Or is it me who has to say goodbye? From now on, there will be no more tears🎵

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.400
🎵No more time for us to be together🎵

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:11.840
🎵Ending the word'you and I'right here🎵
