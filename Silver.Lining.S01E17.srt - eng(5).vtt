WEBVTT

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.480
Young Master

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.120
It's Old K.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.480
Old K

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.960
Qu Bai

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.120
You've crossed the line.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.000
As a core member of the group,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.120
you should know better

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160
than to interfere with matters that aren't your responsibility.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.490
Don't use your judgment

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.210
to influence my decisions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.920
Understand?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.240
I broke the rules

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.960
and willingly accept punishment.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.420
Punishment is necessary.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.120
But now there's something more important

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.200
for you to do.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.380
Please tell me.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.240
Go to Yuji Town tomorrow.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.700
There's a good show

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.720
waiting for you to take part in.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.520
Alright.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.380
What do you think about this case?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.200
Although the case has become somewhat clear,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.660
there are still questions without answers.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840
The fox wanted to use others to obtain the remains

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.280
and deliberately disposed of the body to draw police investigation.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.800
What exactly is she trying to do?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.600
Is it just to provoke the police?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.770
I think it's more than that.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.880
And also,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.360
there's something else.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.960
The number 25

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120
has appeared for the third time now.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800
If the previous two cases

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.480
also shared the number 12,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.760
then in this case,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.690
the number 12 hasn't appeared yet.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.880
What is the Fox trying to hint at or remind us of?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.560
This Fox

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.770
is quite something.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.680
In the previous teacher hypnosis case,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.000
she became the hypnotist behind Xu Yang.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.880
Now she's started directing

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.040
the fake Pan Haili behind Zheng Lanshu.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.720
Manipulating her to fight violence with violence.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
No matter how the killer confesses,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.880
no matter how much evidence we have,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.280
there's no way

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.810
to prosecute these manipulators behind the scenes.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360
For Zheng Lanshu's case,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.880
the prosecutor's office will likely

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.280
postpone it due to insufficient evidence.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.920
But we all know she was being used.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.840
Since there's not enough evidence to convict,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280
we'll just keep looking for more evidence.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.080
Isn't that the principle you've always followed, Captain Luo?

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.920
The person behind this keeps provoking the police,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920
but they'll slip up eventually.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.820
We have plenty of time.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.520
Right.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120
But we can't completely trust what Yu Jia says.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.800
I think we should arrange for additional investigation.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.460
Meanwhile,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.480
we'll put out a warrant for this fake Pan Haili.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
Sooner or later,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.520
we'll catch all these behind-the-scenes manipulators.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.940
This Pei Xinlu is quite interesting.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.400
His taste is quite consistent.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.079
When he cheats,

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.400
he always chooses women who look similar to Zhou Wanrou.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.640
People who don't know better

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.770
would definitely mistake these two for the same person.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.880
Tu Guoan's suicide attempt

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.010
The results are out.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.050
What's the conclusion?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.519
The conclusion is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.440
that Tu Guoan's suicide attempt

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.760
has nothing to do with Chi Xia.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.520
However,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.440
I discovered something unusual.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.280
What is it?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.320
After Tu Guoan was executed,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.920
the detention center notified his brother,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.040
Tu Guolin,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.240
to handle the aftermath as a family member.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.900
But it was Tu Guolin's ex-wife who went instead.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.720
Tu Guolin's ex-wife?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.680
Yes,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.480
that's right.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.000
And I also found out

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.960
things like hiring a lawyer,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.320
delivering clothes,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.680
were all handled by Tu Guolin's ex-wife.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.080
During the trial,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.940
she was also the one who attended.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.360
Such a caring former sister-in-law

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.280
is quite rare.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.320
Indeed.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.680
Tu Guolin once said

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.280
after their parents divorced,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.960
he had no contact with Tu Guoan.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520
He even went around saying

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.040
that whether his brother Tu Guoan lived or died

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.040
had nothing to do with him.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.040
However,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.360
after the Zhou family massacre,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.120
Tu Guoan went to Tu Guolin's company to find him.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.040
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.570
Did you think of something?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.640
No.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.920
Let's eat.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.560
It's getting cold.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.200
Hurry up.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.500
That hairstyle still looks good.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.480
Thank you.

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.120
Sit down and eat.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.760
How's that information I asked you to find out?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.960
I've been running around all day.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.820
You won't even let me eat in peace.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.840
These days,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.480
I've visited every woodcarving shop in Dongzhou.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.280
I specifically looked for experienced craftsmen,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.400
and they told me

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.160
that carving knives,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.680
based on the shape of the blade,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.280
are generally divided into three types:

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.080
U-shaped,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.000
V-shaped,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.120
and W-shaped,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.680
which is the round type,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.080
angular type,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.540
and multi-flexible type.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240
This one here

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.960
was carved with a U-shaped knife.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.680
The knife strokes are unsteady,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.720
the patterns are uneven,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.360
clearly handmade.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.160
This one

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.000
was carved with a micro knife.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.960
The cuts are steady,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.200
and on the edges,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.840
there are traces of polishing.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.570
This is clearly machine-made.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.880
Did you find out

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.440
where it was carved

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.360
or what kind of machine made it?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.440
Shi Tianyi,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.159
are you even taking this seriously?

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.159
Of course I am.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.200
I was just joking with you.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.120
Don't joke with me.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.080
I don't have time for jokes.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.010
Tell me quickly.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.040
An old craftsman told me

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.440
that the style in the photo

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.520
looks exactly like the work from Dongzhou's earliest

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.760
factory that imported woodcarving machines.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.560
I specifically investigated this factory.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.120
It closed down ten years ago.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.920
The previous owner was called

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.480
Tu Guolin.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.320
What's wrong?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.770
Why aren't you home yet so late?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.680
I came back to get something.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400
That's fine then.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.240
Let me know if you need anything.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.920
I'm going.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.680
Captain Luo,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.220
I need to report something to you.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.420
How did you get the physical evidence

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.640
from the Zhou family massacre case?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.159
It's not what you think.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:54.000
This was sent to my school

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.400
a few days before my parents' accident.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.000
At first, I didn't connect this

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.840
to my parents' death.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.280
But when I was at the provincial office

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.680
analyzing cases for criminal psychology,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.520
I accidentally discovered

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.320
that at the Zhou family massacre scene,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.780
there was also a similar wooden cat carving.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.280
This is a photo of the wooden cat carving

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.480
left at the Zhou family massacre scene.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.720
I only have the photo.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.920
The Zhou family massacre

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.120
happened across from my neighborhood,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.600
three days before the fire at my home.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.170
It's too coincidental.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.539
I don't believe it's just chance.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.400
There must be

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.120
some connection between these two cases.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.159
And I recently received information

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.690
that the wooden cat carving from the Zhou case

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.640
likely came from a now-closed wood carving factory.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.480
And the owner of that factory

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.480
is Tu Guo'an's brother,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.680
Tu Guolin.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.680
Help!

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.560
Help!

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.320
What are you yelling about?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.240
You scared me.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.000
Number Three,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.660
why are you making such a fuss?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.040
My arm.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.120
My arm hurts too.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.600
Now that you mention it,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.460
my arm doesn't feel right either.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.600
Maybe the three of us crashed into something.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.840
Where are we anyway?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.900
We haven't been

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.520
kidnapped, have we?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.720
My phone is gone.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.000
Who cares about phones right now?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.680
Go check

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.140
if we can open the windows.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.120
Number Three,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.160
see if there's any other way out.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.800
So what you're saying is

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.360
that the cat wooden carving found

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.220
at the Zhou family massacre scene

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.380
came from Tu Guolin's woodcarving factory?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.520
I'm not sure.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.980
I don't have any evidence.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.800
There's no evidence proving

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.120
that this cat carving

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.850
came from Tu Guolin's factory.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.680
I just know his brother likes cats.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.400
And his older brother happened to be in that business.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.640
There must be

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.690
some connection between them.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.880
Why are you telling me this?

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.840
I want to investigate Tu Guolin.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.320
To be honest,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.370
I also have some information about Tu Guolin.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.800
Brother,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.360
all the doors and windows are locked.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.420
We can't open them.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.250
Brother,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.770
there's a door here.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.520
Brother, wait for me!

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.300
What are we going to do?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.760
These windows are sealed shut too.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.240
We can't get out, brother.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.380
The Mountain God statue has protected Yuji Town residents for generations.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.880
Without a Yuji resident,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.560
outsiders can never leave Dead Man's Mountain.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.240
Why?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.720
We could all leave together.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.760
Why would they do this?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.080
Why?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.880
Brother, be quiet.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880
I hear something.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.040
He's calling out.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.840
Let's go check.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.760
I...

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920
Go look.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.580
Third Brother.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.940
Third Brother!

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.120
Third Brother, I'm here!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.460
What's wrong with you?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.400
Brother,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.960
this place is cursed.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.280
Quick!

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.280
Get inside!

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.040
Hurry!

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.960
Close the door!

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.720
Yes!

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.000
We must not go outside.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.560
We can't go out.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.090
We've encountered a ghost.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.960
We really have seen a ghost!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.960
I'm telling you,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.280
it's too creepy.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.960
Brother,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.860
don't you feel it's getting cold?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.120
Someone at the detention center told me

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.160
that the person who handled Tu Guo'an's affairs

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.680
was Tu Guolin's ex-wife.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.400
Not only that,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.880
but the one who handled

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.520
the legal procedures for Tu Guo'an

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.980
was also this same person.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.160
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.360
Is there something written on my face?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.280
Don't you think Tu Guolin's

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.680
ex-wife is highly suspicious?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.520
I do.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.970
Does this mean you agree to let me investigate Tu Guolin?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.500
I didn't agree to that.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.240
This is just sharing information between colleagues.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.800
Chi Xia,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.840
let me remind you.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.160
Tu Guolin is a highly respected

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.440
local entrepreneur in Dongzhou.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.160
And there's currently no direct evidence showing

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.320
that he's involved in any illegal activities.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.980
You must not act impulsively.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.060
Investigating on your own is against regulations.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.320
I know.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.840
Since you're being honest with me,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.840
I'll be candid with you too.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.520
I've been keeping things from you about Zhou Yanchen's case.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.920
But before we get to business,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.840
I have a little secret

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600
I want to share with you.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.260
What do you want to say?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.800
Who are you?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.780
Where do you come from?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.120
What have you really done?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.680
I think

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.680
you must want to know even more than I do.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.040
It was from that moment

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.970
my memory started to loosen up.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.760
Every time a case guided by the fox appears,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.560
a part of my memory returns.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.880
So I believe

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.300
the fox is coming after me.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.480
I'm sorry,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.210
Captain Luo.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.760
I know I was wrong.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.600
I shouldn't have acted on my own

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.800
without permission.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.840
But honestly,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.770
you weren't easy to trust at first.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.160
The fire case at my home

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.420
was handled by your sister, Luo Lingfei.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.440
Your sister hastily closed the case back then,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.080
and I'm certain something was fishy about it.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.320
So I won't give up on any possibility

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.920
that might lead to the truth.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.080
But after working with you,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.880
I feel that

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.840
Captain Luo is truly

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.660
straightforward,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.160
sincere,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.280
and an extremely trustworthy partner.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.560
Since we've cleared things up today,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.490
let's trust each other from now on.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.240
Are you done?

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.400
Thanks for the compliments.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.040
Investigating cases

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.760
is simply our duty.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.560
There's nothing special about that.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.640
As for that fox,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.320
whatever her purpose is,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.640
we'll make sure she never gets away.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.090
Your personal secrets,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.200
if you don't want to tell me,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.080
I won't ask.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.080
But

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.600
if you want to tell me,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.140
I'm here to listen.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.160
If you need any help,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440
just say the word.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.560
Okay.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.890
Thank you, Captain Luo.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.000
Check inside as well.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.360
Yes.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.120
What's going on?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.800
Come, take it slow.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.760
What happened?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.380
The village chief is here.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.120
What's wrong here?

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.920
Officer Wei.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.520
What is this?

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.360
People are dead.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.160
Three of them.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.800
They were all found in this room.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.840
That's impossible.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.320
The statues in this room...

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.380
Especially the mountain god statues...

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.680
They're all made of wood.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.160
We were afraid of insects getting in,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
so we sealed all the doors and windows.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.690
They've never been opened.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.119
When we came in,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.160
this door was open.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.760
The inner room was blocked.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.560
It took a lot of effort to open it.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.250
Something's wrong.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.960
I remember there were ten sculptures in this house.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.920
How did it become twelve now?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.640
Ten?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.040
You mean...

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.300
someone deliberately brought two more?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.160
I might be mistaken.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.960
This is really unfortunate.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.360
This resort has been abandoned for seven or eight years.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
No one has ever come here.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.880
Now someone finally shows interest

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.320
and is ready to buy it.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.440
And suddenly three people are dead.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.040
It's like we're cursed.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.620
Someone bought it?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.400
Yes.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.080
The county is working on poverty alleviation

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.610
and attracting investment in Dongzhou City.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.280
This businessman is willing to come to our town

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.920
to take over the Bailong Resort

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.240
and continue its development.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.040
In fact,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.440
the contract was just signed recently.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.980
Developing this abandoned project?

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.980
This businessman's hometown

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.960
is our Yuji.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.360
He probably made money

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.360
and wants to come back

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.000
to give back to the villagers

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.220
and lead everyone to prosperity.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120
What's his name?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.400
Tu Guolin.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.420
He's in foreign trade.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.680
He's a well-known entrepreneur in our Dongzhou City.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.000
The village chief said that in this abandoned house,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.880
there used to be only 10 statues,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.640
but somehow the number increased to 12,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.770
so it's possible the killer deliberately moved them in.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.740
The number 12 has appeared again.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.680
I'm afraid

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.520
we've been lured here too.
