00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.280
POLICE

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.500
Just go inside.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.160
What's wrong, sir?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.420
Did something happen?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.730
Let me help you up first.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.680
It's okay.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.210
We can talk about it inside.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.050
Let me take you in first.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.120
Take it slow, sir.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.980
Let's get you up first.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.580
We can talk inside.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440
Let me help you up.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.360
Come on.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.360
Sir, let's go.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.620
We can talk inside.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.600
Sir.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.720
Take it slow.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.800
I've fulfilled

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.570
everything I promised you.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.120
So where's my array?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.460
Listen carefully.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.170
The sequence is:

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.840
25,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.480
14,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.000
12,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.480
14,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.120
25,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.640
12.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.680
We consulted with several

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.880
international cryptography experts to decode it.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.010
We calculated over a dozen solutions.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.560
At first we thought Chi Xia had deceived us.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.640
We almost gave up.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.810
But eventually,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.520
we were able to derive

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.220
these English letters from the numbers.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.280
We originally had three numbers

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.079
corresponding to three letters in the master key.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.720
Now we have the complete sequence.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.120
And the order is correct.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.600
We've finally obtained

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.360
the corresponding eight-letter combination.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.579
These combinations took considerable effort.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.440
But hard work pays off.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.280
Some parts do match up.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.640
It seems that Chi Xia

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.200
wasn't lying.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.530
This address...

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.420
Should we tell Chi Xia?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.770
Of course we should.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.120
The key is how we tell her.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.800
You mean give her a fake address

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.600
to see if she passes the information to the police?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.000
You suspect there's something fishy about her being wanted by police?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.530
We can't let our guard down.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.880
Tomorrow,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.760
6 PM,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.680
Lizang Museum.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.920
Your phone.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.160
You're not going there.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.360
Old K has a job for you.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.519
What job?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.100
It's also tomorrow at 6 PM.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.440
You'll represent Lawa Village

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.960
and go with the Kote Group to Lilong Hotel at the border.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.880
Negotiate with the pharmacist

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.010
and bring them back.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.610
Who is this pharmacist?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.840
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.720
If I were you,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.640
I'd make sure tomorrow's mission goes smoothly.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.970
This is the last chance Old K is giving you.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.380
Don't disappoint him.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
If anything goes wrong,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.220
you'll be the first to die.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.680
Old K can't afford to offend the Kert Group.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.960
Whatever demands they make,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.920
he can't refuse.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
So this is his test for me, right?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.120
He's really got guts.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.730
He signed the contract.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.400
If we can't deliver by the 8th of next month,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.140
none of us will have peace.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.080
Maybe

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.370
he thinks we're already at the end of our rope.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.360
Take care of yourself tomorrow.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.210
Let's go.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600
Everything is ready.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.330
Don't worry.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.120
We've arranged everything.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.580
Come on.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.240
The vehicles and personnel back home are all arranged.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.440
All reliable guys.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.440
Let's go.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.760
We should get going too.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
Follow that car.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.880
Aren't we going to the Lizang Museum?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.140
Why are we also going to the Lilong Hotel?

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.810
Who said Chi Xia was going to the hotel?

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.760
Chief Chang,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.490
Old K's gang has officially entered the country.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.320
Good.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.530
Notify all teams

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.900
to proceed as planned.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.100
Roger that.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.360
I see.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.640
These cops

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.000
are so naive.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.640
They've surrounded the museum as expected.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.560
Without fail,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320
we'll be getting a call from Lilong Hotel soon.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720
That little fox

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.850
still can't be trusted.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.520
Don't worry.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.330
I'm in no hurry to deal with her.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.920
She still has her uses.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.440
Unbelievable, isn't it?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.200
Little fox.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.330
You're still too green.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.080
Think about your police partners

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.320
finding nothing at the Lizang Museum

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.159
and the Lilong Hotel.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.890
Their frustrated expressions

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.320
make me laugh.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.760
Have someone secure the perimeter.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.840
Don't be too obvious.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.560
Yes.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.520
You three,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.640
go get the coded box.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.160
Okay.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.320
This one

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.159
is found.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.000
Tell me.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.960
Even if this thing falls into the police's hands,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.160
what good would it do?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.880
The password

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.140
is only known to me.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.760
What do you want me to say?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.620
Praise you for being so calculating?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.160
It's a game.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.280
There are naturally wins and losses.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.480
Don't be a sore loser.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.960
You've spent so much time

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.210
looking for this password box.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.840
Why not

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.360
verify it with me?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.200
What a pity.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.400
Just one move away.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.520
Officer Chi.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.960
Are you here to see Mr. Qu?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:08.920
Yes.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.120
He's not here.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.520
Also,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.840
we're selling this place to someone else.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.680
Why?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.520
We're developing some new business

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.580
and don't want to spend time on this boxing gym anymore.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.040
By the way,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.440
you came at the right time.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.320
He said you left some things here

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.480
and he put them in the locker for you.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.600
The password is

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.760
Yesterday

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.610
someone broke into my home.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.880
The photo on my desk was moved.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.720
Someone went through my diary on the bookshelf.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.560
The bookmark was in a different place.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.240
Yesterday?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.360
Yes.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.600
I think it happened when we went to see Tu Guo'an.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.800
I suspect they were after the data array.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.520
Also,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.160
Qu Bai is selling his boxing gym.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.360
They say there's new business coming.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.560
This new business,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.120
could it be methcathinone?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.960
I think so.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.240
They don't even have the formula yet.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.280
They're in such a hurry to start this new business.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.800
Seems like this Old K is pretty confident.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.840
He believes

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.920
once he gets the data array,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.120
he can locate the place.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.440
Does that mean

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.840
he already has

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.010
the cipher key to decode the location?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.080
Chief Chang.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.920
My parents' case

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.560
and this criminal organization's case

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.600
are both closely connected to me.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.320
So

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.000
I should recuse myself.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.960
Wait.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.760
Listen to me.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.040
Following Tu Guo'an's lead,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.520
we've confirmed that Chi Xiao is indeed guilty.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.120
She's the mastermind behind six murder cases,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.400
including Chi Xia's parents' case,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.800
and she was also involved in their execution.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.640
This Old K

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.240
went to extreme lengths

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.560
to trigger Chi Xia's memory

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.280
and obtain the formula.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.160
He repeatedly manipulated

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.960
and created the vigilante case.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.000
Chief Chang.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.280
If...

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920
I mean, what if

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.920
Chi Xia had also chosen violence

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.930
and killed Chi Xiao?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.560
Go on.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.840
Of course.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.960
We're not actually having Chi Xia kill anyone.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.000
Instead, we're going to stage

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.040
a scenario where Chi Xia kills Chi Xiao.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.080
This way,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.280
Chi Xia will be placed in a completely isolated position.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.640
Under these circumstances,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.440
Old K will definitely reach out to Chi Xia,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.280
who has both the array data

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.210
and has turned against the police.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.100
Chi Xia can then extract the master password

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.840
and figure out the location.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.720
This way,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.720
our people

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.380
can set up surveillance at the scene in advance.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.160
Finally,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.380
we've got them like rats in a trap.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.200
All contacts are in place.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.400
Are all teams ready?

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.200
Ready.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.890
Captain Luo,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.000
our man is back.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.560
Good.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.840
Find an opportunity to expose yourself.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.360
Okay,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.080
no problem.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.200
Brother,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.120
put Curly

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.360
at the truck parking spot later.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.200
Chi Xia will coordinate with us from the office.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.080
Cao Bin has confirmed

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.360
that Chi Xiao is at his hideout.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.560
We can proceed with the arrest.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.440
Notify all teams

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.040
to move in.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.560
Got it.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.610
Captain Luo.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.760
Chi Xiao must have noticed she's being followed.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.090
She's driving away now.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.120
I'm tailing her.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.600
Cao Bin.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.680
Keep your car closer to hers.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.600
Let Chi Xiao clearly notice it.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.200
Copy that.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.440
Curly.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.320
Have you reached the designated position?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.000
Almost there.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.080
Almost there, Captain Luo.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.800
Chi Xia.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.600
You can go to the abandoned building now.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.520
I've already set up the surveillance there.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.320
They're all disguised

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.240
as civilian cameras for monitoring forest fires.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.520
They'll definitely capture everything.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.320
No problem.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.760
I'll go ahead then.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.520
Be careful.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.560
Let's go.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.000
Curly.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.040
Are you ready on your end?

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.840
All set.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.840
Remove the police light.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.480
Curly.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.200
Get ready.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920
Let's go, driver.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.480
Dong E·C4757.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.040
Captain Luo.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.700
The target has taken the bait.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.360
Chi Xia.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.020
It's your turn now.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.760
Captain Luo.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.220
The target has moved past.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.880
Captain Luo.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.960
I'm following Chi Xiao now.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.690
It's exactly where we planned.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
She took the bait.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.800
Chi Xia,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.640
you coward!

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.520
I know about Chi Xiao.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.720
Where are you?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400
Can we meet?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.859
Chi Xia.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.329
Captain Luo,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.579
they took the bait.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.319
Great!

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.720
First, ensure your own safety.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.569
Let me know if there's any problem.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.800
Um...

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.319
What?

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:24.680
Worried that I'm using Qu Bai

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.079
and feeling bad about it?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.240
Everything is to catch Old K.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.680
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.520
We focus on action.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.720
Don't worry about me.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.000
I'm relieved you think that way.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.840
I trust you.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:51.980
Yuan Weimin

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.720
According to the news from Chi Xia.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.520
Comrade Fu Gang's current

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.600
physical and mental condition is very concerning.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.880
We must act quickly

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.920
at all costs

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.720
to rescue Comrade Fu Gang.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.960
Luo Xun.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.000
After you go back,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.120
come up with an action plan immediately.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.840
Understood,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.570
Chief Chang.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
I have good news.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.410
The cipher master copy has been found.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.640
You found it?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.060
How did you find it?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.680
Old Zhang loved Chinese opera when he was alive.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.480
He particularly enjoyed 'Sanchaku'.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.280
He said

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.600
the characters in opera

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.240
all work together as a team

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.280
to fight against evil forces.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.520
The core spirit of justice triumphing over evil

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.180
aligns perfectly with the police's mission to eliminate criminals.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.800
Old Zhang and his partner

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.560
spent their entire lives

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.080
upholding

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.920
this script.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.940
It was given to him by his partner.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280
I heard him say

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.920
that each of them had a copy.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.360
When they left,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.640
they kept reminding me

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.680
to keep it safe.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.120
This is the master copy of the code.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.880
Yes,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.920
and we've already deciphered

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.970
the location information represented by the array.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.840
There aren't many pages here.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.240
We still don't know

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.760
the decryption rules.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.890
Can we trust the decoded information?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.970
Director Chang,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.920
actually,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.680
we do have some clues.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.160
Look at these three.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.840
Curly hair.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.620
The item might be hidden in this person's grave,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.560
or even in his urn.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.600
Without the password,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600
forcing it open

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.080
would destroy all the formulas inside.
