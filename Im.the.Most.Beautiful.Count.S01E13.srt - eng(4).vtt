WEBVTT

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.280
Once our mission is complete,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.560
there shall be no more

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.560
bloodshed and struggle for power.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.680
The order where men once ruled supreme

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.039
will be replaced by equality.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.920
Everyone will live freely,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.759
serving no one but themselves.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.720
Hey, that’s a guy in drag!

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.200
Take him and behead him!

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.320
Worradej, wake up!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.720
Waradej… I can’t live without you.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.560
If your wish truly comes to pass,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
will we finally return home?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.240
Banjong.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.880
Take him away, lock him up.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.160
Chet!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.800
Will you release me now, huh?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.000
Will you let me go yet?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.000
Don’t,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.960
Why stop me?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.480
I must save my brother!

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.320
Think carefully, my lord.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.680
To reach this day,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720
we have endured so much.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.800
We have lost so very much.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.560
Just a little more.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480
Your desire to change the realm

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.480
shall then be fulfilled.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.720
Would you make everything fall?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.960
All for the sake of your brother alone?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.640
Look him in the face.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.800
He is the only brother you have left.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760
Will you let him die?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.200
When you could save his very life?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.560
If so,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.840
then you shall be known as,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840
the vilest brother in all the world.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.280
Kosol!

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.120
Chaiyachet’s life,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.320
matters greatly to you, does it not?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.880
What say you?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.200
Will you let your only brother die?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.360
Who says

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.320
that this one is my beloved brother?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.160
He is the trouble in my life instead.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.120
If you kill him this very moment,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.040
you would rid my life of a burden.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.240
Do it.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.880
Shoot him.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.360
Kosol, please think it over.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.880
Consider it carefully first.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.400
- My lord...
- Brother speaks true.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.600
The welfare of the people

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.760
matters more than my single life.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
If you would slay me,

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.720
then strike the blow.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.720
What shall we do, Your Highness?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.880
You cannot leave Chet thus.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.320
Kosol, you must help Chet, Kosol.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.920
Do whatever you must.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200
For I have no weak brother,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.640
nor one who easily yields.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.520
Who waits always for another’s aid.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.040
Elder Kosol,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.840
help me.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.440
Do not interfere.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.160
We are merely playing hostage-takers.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.520
We do no harm.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
Do as you will, then.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.040
I do not have a weak, cowardly brother

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.120
who always waits for others' aid.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.600
Chet!

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.120
Chet!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.720
Chet!

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.280
Chet.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.200
Chet.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.480
Chet.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.600
Hmm, I’m jealous.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.320
I’d love a microwave brother like him.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.480
I’d fawn over him morning, noon,
and night.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.360
I’d dote without stopping.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.320
Chet will wake soon.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.040
Kosol , Chet has awakened.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.840
You’re awake, then?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.760
I thought you were gone.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.640
You two,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.880
fetch rice and fish for my brother.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.480
I must attend to business first.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.880
What on earth is his problem?

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.240
Easy does it, Your Highness.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.560
Chet, please,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.000
don’t mind him, okay?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.480
He’s always stubborn like this.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.800
All show, full of airs.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.880
He is my brother.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.360
I know him well.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.600
And...

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.800
who put medicine in my mouth?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.280
Who else would it be?

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.840
The one who just stormed out with a huff.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.440
He wiped you down and changed your clothes.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.919
Tended your wounds,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.600
and wouldn’t let anyone else help.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.280
Said he’d do it himself,
afraid others might hurt you.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.960
Truly, Your Highness, even just now,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.840
I was about to fart,
and he told me to hold it in!

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.720
He feared it might wake you.
Right, Banjong?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.160
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.560
And what of Jet, Your Majesty?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.080
Jet... he...

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.240
My lord, flee now!

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.400
I will deal with him myself!

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.080
No. I’ll never abandon you.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.480
We’ll fight together till the end.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.400
Jet...

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.160
Farewell, Jet.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.600
You’ll always be my friend.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.800
Your Majesty.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.200
Are you man or spirit, Your Majesty?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.760
I feared if you knew it was all staged,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.320
you wouldn’t feel sorrow.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.800
- We had to deceive you, my lord.
- Your Majesty...

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.280
Please, never do such a thing again, sire.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.880
You will always remain in my heart.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.200
And if one day,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.200
I am no longer king,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.280
will we be closer then?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.400
Now I’m just a common man, same as you.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.840
You can stop being so stiff.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.480
As you wish, my lord.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.400
Thank you, my dear friend.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.960
Brother Chet, isn’t Jet handsome?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.760
I told you before, you’re my friend.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.600
Friends should share everything equally.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.920
Don’t worry, Jet.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.520
I’ll take good care of myself.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.080
Farewell, Jet.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.960
Why don’t you rest?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.200
Your body hasn’t fully recovered yet.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.760
Why come up here again?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.280
Well, back then,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.640
you’re the one who brought
me up here, aren’t you?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.200
You said it was the first test of courage.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.920
But when I saw the beautiful sky above,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.640
I stopped being afraid.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.280
That was ages ago.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.640
You still remember?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.120
I remember everything,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.760
every moment I spent with you.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.040
Including the time
I was bullied by others,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.680
and you didn’t help me.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.760
You even said you had
no weak brother like me.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.280
Thank you.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.440
I didn’t help you at all.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.120
Why thank me?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.480
Who says you didn’t?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.080
You gave me the strength to stand and fight.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.480
To fight them off.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.800
Nonsense.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.520
That’s all in your head.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.880
I know better.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
That’s just your way of teaching me.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.960
Stop pretending, brother.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.680
I said it’s nonsense!

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.720
All right, nonsense it is.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.480
I, King Chaiyached,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.520
former ruler of Thanapura,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.480
hereby renounce the royal throne.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.800
From this day forth, no ruler

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.600
nor noble shall inherit power
by bloodline again.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.880
Then who shall rule us?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.240
Somdet Saenyakorn

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.280
and all his ministers have lost their power.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.960
The slave system that once oppressed you all,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.240
has been abolished entirely.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.800
- Good! Good!
- Excellent!

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.160
From this moment,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.200
you are free men and women.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.560
You no longer have to serve anyone,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.000
nor belong to anyone ever again.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.240
And let me also announce,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.520
those laws that invade

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320
your freedom and privacy,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.560
like forbidding who you can love or desire,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.120
forcing you to be this or that,

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.840
are now gone.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.840
Be whoever you want to be.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.120
This new system of governance

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.360
shall be called a republic.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.280
Everyone shall have a voice

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.720
in shaping the nation’s future,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.240
including electing our head of state.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.000
Do not be alarmed, everyone.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.480
Everything will progress step by step.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.160
You’ll come to understand in time.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.720
Worradej.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.040
Worradej! Worradej!

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.120
Worradej! Worradej!

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.040
Worradej!

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.680
What’s wrong, Worradej?

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.280
Worradej!

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.480
That same dream again?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.760
Well, long time no see, darling.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.080
Hey,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.640
why are you here?

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.200
I’m in the middle of explaining the new
government system to the villagers.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.040
Let’s talk about this later, okay?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.960
Just wake me up first.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.160
I didn’t make you fall asleep.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.080
It’s simply time.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.200
Time?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.680
Time for what?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.680
Thank you so much,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.720
for making my wish finally come true.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.880
No need for thanks, really.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.480
Your wish,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.880
was the same as mine.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.080
The mission is complete.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.280
It’s time for you to go home.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.560
Oh!

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.880
That’s right!

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.440
Hey, we’ve got a concert to perform!

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.720
Wait, Worradej!

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.040
The past has already changed.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.840
The future I came from,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.920
what does it look like now?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.960
Do you know? Tell me.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.880
Since Somdet Saenyakorn was imprisoned,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.920
and you all declared the change of regime,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.800
the future has shifted.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.920
This land will be ruled under a republic,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.000
where the people live freely for generations.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.840
Really? And then...

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.520
will I still be an idol?

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.880
What will my songs be about?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.720
Will there still be haters who despise queers?

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.800
Ahh, I’m so excited, Worradej!

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.000
What’s it going to be like? Tell me!

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.720
Don’t ask too much.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.160
You’ll see it yourself once you return.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.240
Is that the path back to the future?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.400
Yes.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.120
Step into it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.560
Worradej, wake up!

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.480
Do you know what’s wrong with Worradej?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.280
Did you notice anything strange this morning?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.800
None at all.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.680
He seemed perfectly fine.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.040
Worradej!

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.599
Worradej, wake up!

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.200
You promised you’d never leave me alone!

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.599
Kosol, Worradej once told me,

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.000
if he ever fainted again,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.319
you must kiss him, and he’ll wake.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.680
Worradej!

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.960
Why isn’t it working?

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.480
Worradej!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.720
You said you’d never leave me alone!

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.080
Hey, Worradej!

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.560
Why has he suddenly gone cold?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.880
Hey, Worradej!

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.200
Worradej!

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.760
You’re right, his pulse is fading.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.680
Don’t hesitate any longer.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.880
It’s time for you to go.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.800
Step forward.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.360
Worradej...

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.120
Please wake up.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.560
Worradej!

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.000
Worradej!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.800
Worradej! I won’t let you die!

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.400
Please, come back to me!

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.880
Hey, Worradej!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.400
Worradej!

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.760
I’ll always be by your side.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.720
No matter where you are, or when.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.360
How lucky I am,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.760
that in this world,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.440
someone truly loves me for who I am.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.720
And I love him for who he is.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.080
Kosol...

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.200
I love you.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.000
I promise,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.160
every time I survive and return,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.320
I’ll always come back to you.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.120
Kosol! Kosol!

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.920
Leave me alone, will you?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.200
Can’t you see I’m grieving?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.640
My lord, please, look at Worradej first.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.400
No need.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.240
Worradej’s face has long
been etched in my heart.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.600
Kosol...

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.400
I said don’t call me!

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.000
I’m grieving!

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.520
Ugh, I’m not dead yet, okay?

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.600
Focus!

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.680
Worradej!

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.560
Am I seeing things?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.760
You’re really not dead, are you?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.960
Yes, nothing’s more real than this.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.280
I’m truly happy, Worradej,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.640
that you didn’t leave me behind.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.920
I came back to you, didn’t I?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.160
Don’t ever leave me again.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.520
If Jade were here,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.200
he’d be lounging in a hammock by now.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.480
I tied it up for you, sir.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.760
Are we missing him so much
we’re hearing things?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.200
Your Majesty Chet!

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.440
It’s me, Jade, Your Majesty!

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.280
Jade...

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.760
Are you human or ghost?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.000
Your Majesty Chet!

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.640
I’m flesh and blood, sir.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.240
I’m human, not a ghost.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.480
Here, look.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.480
You can touch me.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.080
See? You can touch me.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.120
Jade

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.840
Jade, you’re alive!

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.040
You’re still alive!

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.400
You’re alive!

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.920
Yes, I’m here, sir.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.000
You’re alive!

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.920
Chet! What’s all the noise about?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.280
Hey, Jade!

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.320
Jade!

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.880
Wait, you’re not dead?

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.280
Didn’t you get stabbed
straight through the heart?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.640
That’s right, sir.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.760
I was stabbed in the left chest.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.240
But... my heart’s on the right side.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.920
Unlike most people.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.720
Luckily, someone helped me in time.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.280
So I didn’t die, sir.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.120
Wait, there’s really such a thing?
A heart on the right side?

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.560
There is.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.000
I once read a medical text,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.720
it said one in ten thousand people

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.600
have their heart on the right.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.680
Extremely rare, indeed.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.160
Well, that’s good then.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.360
You can help me campaign for votes.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.760
Campaign for what, sir?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.680
Did Your Lordship lose your voice?
Is that why you need to find it?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.800
What campaign, sir? Are you unwell?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.920
Not that kind of campaign!

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.200
I mean for the election!

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.720
The what now, sir?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.800
By now, your son,

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.080
and that Kosol fellow must’ve...

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.920
seized power and made
themselves rulers of the realm.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320
You,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.160
what kind of father are you?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.600
How could you not see
your son’s lust for power?

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.280
His ambitions grew that far.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.320
Back then, my son was a quiet man.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.360
But later on...

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.880
he joined forces with those rebels.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.800
Still, I never thought he’d be so ungrateful,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.680
as to throw his own father into prison.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.680
He hasn’t even come to visit once.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.600
As if I’m not his father at all.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.600
If only you,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.360
had been stricter with him,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.000
and put him in his place sooner,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.080
we wouldn’t be rotting
in this cell together now!

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.280
What?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.440
How dare you blame me alone!

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.760
All the power was in your hands.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.120
You were the one who made all the plans.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.000
You commanded the entire army!

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.120
How could you possibly have lost to him?

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.880
You’re the one who failed!

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.360
Hey, hey.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.440
You dare insult me like this?

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.280
Of course I do.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.280
We're both in prison,
no one's above anyone here.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.080
- Damn it, hey!
- What?

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.920
- What?
- Stop, please!

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.280
Stop, please. Stop fighting already!

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.400
So you came, you ungrateful son.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.840
I thought you'd let your father rot in prison.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.880
Release me this instant!

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.360
Well...

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.480
Calm down, Father.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.760
The reason I came today

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.480
is to discuss your release.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.640
And not just yours, Father.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.920
Uncle Saen’s as well.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.360
You wouldn’t be so kind

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.440
as to free us both that easily.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.360
If there are conditions, speak them now.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.360
Do not drag this out.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.440
Then listen carefully.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.600
Right now, both of you

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.120
are merely prisoners.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.120
You no longer hold any power.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.480
Indeed.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.360
You’ve seized it all anyway.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.520
Not quite.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.200
The power is not ours.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.960
It has already been returned to the people.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.120
The only way you can regain your power

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.440
is if the people grant it to you.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.080
You mean to say...

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.840
a system where power belongs to the people?

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.080
Wow, Uncle Saen actually knows the term?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.240
That’s right.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.800
You’ll have to run for election,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.280
propose policies, and campaign.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.080
If people like you enough,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.360
you may have the right and chance
to rule the country once again.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960
Interested?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.920
If not...

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.000
you can rot and die in this prison then.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.280
Step right up, everyone!
Come gather in the front!

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.600
(Stage rally)

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.040
All right, everyone!

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.560
This will be the very first time

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.680
we’ll get to choose who takes care

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.480
of our joys and sorrows by ourselves.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.560
And now, please welcome the first party,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.800
Candidate Number One!

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.120
The Freedom Rainbow Party!

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.520
Greetings, everyone.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.200
Just as a rainbow has many colors,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.440
so too does humanity come in many shades.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.640
Our party’s policy focus

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.120
is on freedom and liberty,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.840
the right to live freely.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.480
Whatever career one wishes to pursue,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.720
whatever one loves or excels at,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.360
everyone shall be free to follow their heart.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.120
And most importantly...

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.840
we shall have the right to love whom we love,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.480
and the right to marry any gender,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.480
equally and with pride.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.680
All our lives,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.080
we have been oppressed by nobles and lords,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.400
forced to do what we never wished to do.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.600
Those days of suffering will end.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.200
All it takes, my friends,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.920
is your vote for the Freedom Rainbow Party,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.360
Candidate Number One!

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.520
(Number Two)

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.480
Only real men,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.280
strong and righteous,

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.640
are fit to lead and govern this nation!

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.600
Every able-bodied man shall be drafted
to serve the nation.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.440
Children must be taught the doctrines
we have firmly established.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.000
All for the order and peace of our land.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.320
God

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.680
created mankind in only two sexes.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.680
Anyone who deviates from that

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.840
shall be punished accordingly,

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.560
to align with the ideals of our nation.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.800
- Correct! Correct!
- Indeed!

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.800
When that happens,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.320
our nation shall know only peace and harmony.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.680
Strong and united forever.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
All of you here,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.120
must vote for Number Two!

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.360
The Real Men’s Power Party!

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.600
- Number Two! Number Two!
- Number Two!

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.800
- Number Two!
- Number Two!

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.880
Number Two!

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.440
- Number Two!
- Remember, vote only for Number Two!

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.240
- Number Two!
- Number Two!

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.080
Number Two!

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.200
You’ve now heard the policies
of both parties.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.760
Whoever you love, whichever you support,

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.480
on the eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.840
don’t forget to cast your vote!

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.320
at the polling stations, everyone!

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.560
(Stage rally)
Which number will you choose?

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.960
On the eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.800
don’t forget to vote, everyone!

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.400
The eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.320
vote for Number One!

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.520
- Number One!
- Number Two!

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.800
- Number One!
- Number Two!

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.120
Vote for Number One!

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.160
- Number Two!
- Number One!

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.280
Number One!

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.200
Number One!

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.840
- Number One!
- Number One!

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.680
I would like to thank everyone
for your votes.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.480
For choosing me to serve
the people of this nation.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.720
The word “I” sounds...

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.520
a bit too harsh, doesn’t it?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.080
Maybe I should...

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.720
just start using the word “dichan.”

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.920
Dichan would like to thank everyone
for your votes.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.160
For choosing dichan to serve
the people of this nation.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.000
This works better.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.480
What are you doing?

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.800
Today is election day.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.680
Why haven’t you gone to vote yet?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.160
I’m just... excited.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.200
I mean...

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.600
if our party actually wins

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.800
and I end up getting a position,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.520
I need to practice my speech first, right?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.760
I don’t want to embarrass myself
by saying something wrong later.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.080
Are you sure we’ll win?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.920
Somdet’s been bribing villagers

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.560
to make them vote for him.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.280
And those villagers are so naive,

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.000
once they get the money, they’ll vote.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.760
But our intention

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.360
is for the people to truly choose
whom they want.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.600
Otherwise, we’ll never reach our goal.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.840
Even if this system still has flaws,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.400
at least it prevents the villagers

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.640
from killing each other over power, right?

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.800
It may not be the best way,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.120
but it’s not the worst either.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.720
Still, you shouldn’t have let your father
and Somdet join the election.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.120
If their allies win,

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.360
everything will just return to the old ways.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.920
All that we’ve worked for will be wasted.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.960
Oh, come on! But honestly,

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.120
people should have the freedom
to choose from more options.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.800
There might be some people

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.640
who actually prefer Somdet’s ways.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.720
And if they really win the election,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.880
then we’ll have to accept it.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.240
The villagers too must accept the outcome.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.200
When that time comes,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.720
we may have to keep fighting
for a long while, Kosol.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.160
Well, I never knew

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.960
you had such a deep knowledge of politics.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.680
Almost as if you...

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.320
had lived through countless
revolutions yourself.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.560
Well...

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.960
I did study some history, you know.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.840
Events in this world just keep spinning
in the same cycles.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.040
We just need to...

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.240
learn from them and move forward.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.480
Oh my,

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.000
Why do your thoughts

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.120
sound nothing like a man of this century?

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.640
You know,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.120
ever since I met you,

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.280
I’ve wanted to become a better man each day,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.440
to keep growing for the better.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.720
For now, though,

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.280
don’t you dare carry me before I consent.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.680
Then I’d say you’ve evolved
to the next level.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.120
So... may I hold you now?

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.480
You’re crazy...

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.000
Hold me, what are you talking about?

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.800
Aren’t we supposed to go vote?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.600
Forget voting for a moment.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.800
Something of mine just stood up.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.200
You pervert.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.880
Do you like it, though?

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.440
I do.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.880
Then let me carry you.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.760
Mm.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.320
Gently... carry me gently.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.440
Hm?

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.080
I can’t hold you like this anymore.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.960
Hey...

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.719
This position’s too hard to hold.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.080
Then... try another one.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.480
(Election booth)

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.920
(Government ballot)

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.360
I’ve checked around.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.680
Most of the villagers voted for Worradej.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.080
Ugh, how utterly disgusting.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.160
And what about those peasants
we bribed?

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.520
It’s Banjong, of course.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.960
He told the villagers they could
take the money but didn’t have to vote.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.120
Because we’d cheat our way in
to get our money back anyway.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.040
If this keeps up,

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.800
we’ll definitely lose the election.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.280
Then what will you do, sir?

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.640
The election’s already
halfway through the day.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.760
All of you, follow me!

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.920
Hey, stop, stop right there!

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.280
I...

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.920
as your former ruler,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920
believe the time has not yet come

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.400
for you to choose your own leaders.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.080
Granting you that right today

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.200
is premature and reckless.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.280
I and my comrades,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.720
born of noble blood above you,

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.880
more learned and capable than you all,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.160
shall make the sacrifice

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.280
to rule over you once more.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.560
As of this day,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.000
the election is hereby suspended!

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.320
Close the booths!

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.240
Close them, no one shall vote again!

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.240
- Close the booths!
- Hey!

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.480
- That’s enough!
- They’re closed! Move out!

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.360
Hey! Stop!

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.920
Stop! Get out of the way!

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.400
Hey,

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.960
I can’t take it anymore, my lord.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.120
One round and I’m about to pass out.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.800
If there’s... a second round,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.280
I won’t make it!
What on earth did you eat?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.200
If we’re late and the ballot boxes close,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.640
we’ll be humiliated!

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.000
Master! Master, open the door, please!

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.960
Something terrible has happened!

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.200
Master, please!

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.880
What is it, Jade?

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.280
Somdet and the Count gathered men
to block the polling booths!

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.200
They won’t let the villagers vote, sir!

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.400
What?!

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.480
Where is it, Jade?

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.520
Everything seems fine now, doesn’t it?

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.560
Yes, sir.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.800
But just a moment ago,
I swear a fight was about to break out!

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.720
Nisa.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960
Jade said there was chaos here.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.160
Did Somdet and the Count really try
to block the villagers from voting?

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.520
Yes, but they failed.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.520
Stop right there!

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.560
Stop right now!
I said stop this instant!

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.040
What do you think you’re doing?

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.920
You’d better think carefully.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.120
Take a look around you!

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.720
How many of us are there?

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.960
How many hands?

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.920
How many feet?

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.920
You dare to stand against the people’s will?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.400
How can the people ever be greater than me?!

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.720
Huh?! Charge!

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.320
Charge! Charge!

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.520
- Attack!
- Hey!

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.040
You’ll pay for this with your life!

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.200
Worradej, what’s wrong with you?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.520
I’m just overwhelmed,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.920
seeing the villagers

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.000
cherish and defend their rights like this.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.840
I believe from now on,

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.760
Somdet and his men won’t dare
try anything like this again.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.280
Of course not.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.520
If they do,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.320
they’ll be beaten to a pulp for sure.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.680
Come on, let’s go cast our votes.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.680
Have you two voted yet?

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.920
Yes, sir. We voted for
the Freedom Rainbow Party.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.160
I voted early this morning.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.600
But you two, where have you been?

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.480
Why are you showing up just now?

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.920
Well, we...

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.760
No need to explain everything.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.040
Then, we’ll just...

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.200
go cast our votes right away.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.960
Let’s go, then.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.040
- Jade.
- Yes, sir?

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.480
Do you know where those two went?

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.200
No idea, sir.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.120
But when I went to their room,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.040
neither of them were wearing any clothes, sir.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.560
Naked?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.880
Oh my!

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.080
Good heavens.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.440
And now, the election results
of the Saenya people

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.280
are officially in my hands.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.080
Candidate Number One,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.840
the Freedom Rainbow Party,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.280
has received...

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.960
has received...

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.720
2,415 votes!

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.080
And Candidate Number Two,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.680
the Real Men’s Power Party,

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.040
has received...

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.920
has received...

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.480
one vote.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.280
What?!

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.000
None of you voted for me?!

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.200
Well, I sensed things were going south,
so I sided with Worradej.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.600
You’re not mad, right? Right?

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.800
Worradej!

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.520
Oh, my boy, congratulations, son!
I’m so proud of you!

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.520
You’ve done wonderfully! So proud!

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.080
Thank you, Father.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.440
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.200
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.800
- Hooray! Hooray!
- And so,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.320
the party forming the government

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.600
is the Freedom Rainbow Party!

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.560
And our very first head of state is...

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.480
Worradej!

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.640
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.960
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.200
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.720
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.520
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800
I would like to thank everyone

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.120
for choosing me.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.600
to assume this honourable office.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.080
I pledge,

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.960
to serve you all

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.320
with my whole heart.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.640
This royal palace

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.080
will become the seat of government,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.880
ready to welcome every one of you.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.360
And I thank you once again

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.760
for all of you

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.760
who cherish your own freedoms,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.800
who respect the freedoms of others,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.160
and who have fulfilled
your civic duties

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.080
to the fullest.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.400
And now, as we begin anew,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.840
I hereby rename our country

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.040
from Saenya

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.240
to the Thoeyland.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.120
For we are all Thoey people.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.080
“Thoey” means...

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.160
freedom.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.120
Ugh. What is this?

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.280
I will inaugurate

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.640
my spouse and I as the first married couple
of the Thoeyland,

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.280
to show everyone that

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.160
we all have the right to love.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.800
Loving.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.240
And I dedicate this song

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.080
to be the national song of our Thoeyland.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.600
Music.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.360
Cut. And then,

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.080
(Still puzzled)
What did I just get hit by?

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.240
A mosquito.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.440
It crawls in the ear, bites the face,

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.120
then it nips the leg.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.080
(The lock’s too tight.)
It hurts, feels like being chained.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.080
Stripped of the viceroy title.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.000
Sent to prison for ten years.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Ten years later, I’ll get revenge.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.880
(Ten years is never too late.)

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.080
Which number will you choose?

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.720
Number One.
(Number One, of course, my Count.)
