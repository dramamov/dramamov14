00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440
What has he done to you? Why do you hate him so much?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.880
Because he’s the Naga!

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.280
Let go of me.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.080
No, I’ll never leave you here.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.040
What are you doing?! No. No! Phaya!

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.800
No. No!

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.520
Phaya!

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.280
Everyone that I love are taken away from me, all because of you.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920
It’s time for you to choose.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.400
This is not just about Phaya, the man you love.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.040
It’s about everyone that you love.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360
You know the whereabout of Montree and his every move...

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.640
because Chart is your spy?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.360
That’s right.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.800
I have recruited him to work secretly...

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.600
after he didn’t pass the training at the camp.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.000
Disguising himself as one of Montree’s people, I sent him to find more evidence on the drug network.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.280
and also evidence on Tharn’s father’s murder as well as my brother’s and Lieut Tam’s cases.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.120
That day we secretly went to investigate on the spider tattoo,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.720
Chart was also there. Was it your order?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.120
If we had arrested Khom that day, everything would just end there.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.280
We’d never able to get to Montree.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.080
Why didn’t you tell us anything, especially Tharn?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.400
- If Tharn had known about this...
- Because I don’t trust anyone.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.120
I can’t trust anyone even you.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.360
Lieut Tam died because someone in our unit tipped that information off.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.880
Inspector.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.760
Singh has tracked down Chart’s last location.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.039
But it’s not clear.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.800
We only know it’s close to our target area.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.840
What about Phaya and Tharn, can you track them down?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.280
Yes, they’re on the west side.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.800
Only 5 kilometres away from Chart’s location.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.880
Let’s split up into 2 teams.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.759
Yai, go look for Phaya and Tharn with the forest rangers.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920
The rest of you come with me. We’ll go arrest Montree.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.680
Yes, sir.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.320
Can you show me the map?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.680
- Come here.
- What is it?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.080
Just come.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.080
What is it?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.800
Here.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.440
Keep it for me first. Once everything is done, I’ll come back and put it on your ring finger.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.120
Don’t be so full of yourself.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.079
I’ve never said I would let you do that.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.680
This mission is really dangerous. Please be careful.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.160
Yeah, you too.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.360
(Incoming call)

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.720
Hello, babe.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.320
I’m with Tharn’s grandma right now.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.840
Have you found him?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.840
Not yet. We’d get going now.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.480
Okay, please find them.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.960
Yeah. By the way, can you make me a spicy fish paste when I go back?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.360
I want to eat it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.079
Of course, I’ll make it for you.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.560
Please come back soon. And promise me you’ll come back safely too.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.360
Or else, I’ll throw it away. Got it?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.160
Okay.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.160
Please be careful.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.160
He still hasn’t found them.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.079
Please, let both of them come back safely.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.040
I pray to all the holy spirits, please protect everyone and make them come back safely.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:52.040
Please protect Phaya and Tharn too.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.240
Dad, Mum. Please help protect Phaya and bring him back saftely.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.840
I promise I will be good to him.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.080
And will listen to everything he says.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.840
Got it.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.760
Gather up, everyone!

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.200
Let’s go, Yai.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.080
Yes, sir.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.720
Yai, please find Phaya and Tharn.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.280
Yeah, you guys be careful too.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.080
I promise I’ll catch up to help arrest Montree.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.720
Let’s go.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.760
The rest of you, come with me.

Tharn, I’ll go look that way.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.840
Okay.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.480
- Tharn, I’ll go look that way.
- Okay.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.880
Are you going to tell me now, whom you were just talking to on the phone?

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:46.159
Sir, the cops are coming.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.480
Tell our men to clear the warehouse.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.080
Hey, look! The light.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.360
Come.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.120
Come.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.120
This is where I heard the shooting yesterday.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.120
This way.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.760
Wait a second.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.360
Let’s hurry up. I think the persons I’m looking for are probably around here.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.160
Careful.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.640
Help!

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.920
Help!

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.120
Can anyone hear us?!

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.160
Help!

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.640
Help! Anybody, help!

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.080
Help!

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.960
Can you hear us?! Help!

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.680
Help!

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.560
Anybody, help!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.600
Help!

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.200
Tharn! Phaya!

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.480
Yai!

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.640
Sit down first. I thought I’d never see both of you again.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.480
Why do you guys always get yourselves into danger like this?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.080
We are so worried about you.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.560
How did you find us?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.560
Inspector and our team...

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.000
are going to raid Montree’s drugs warehouse around here.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.160
Montree’s drugs warehouse?

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.040
How did Inspector find out?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.360
Chart is his spy. He’s secretly working for Inspector.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.240
He was the one who told Inspector...

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.560
about you two after Khom tried to kill you.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.680
Chart is Inspector’s spy.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.680
(Gunshot)

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.240
Khem, let’s go.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:05.720
(Gunshot)

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.240
Already started?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.120
You two go back first.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.080
I have to go help our team and Inspector.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.360
Wait, take us with you.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360
Look at yourself, how can you help us?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.680
I’m okay. I can do it.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.280
Let us help, Yai.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.560
I’m not going to miss this chance to arrest Montree.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.200
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:36.120
(Gunshot)

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.200
(Gunshot)

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.160
Cover him.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.360
Go back!

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.080
Go back! Back!

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.960
Go after them!

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.160
Yes, sir.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.200
Burn them all! Get him up, he’s coming with us.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.960
Hey!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.400
Let’s go.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.040
Let’s go.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.000
Walk!

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.520
(Gunshot)

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.760
(Gunshot)

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.240
Go! Go! Go!

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.680
Dammit! Why can’t they just leave me alone?!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.320
Drop your weapons and turn yourself in!

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.560
(Gunshot)

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.920
(Explosion)

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.080
(Gunshot)

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.680
(Gunshot)

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.040
Let’s go back!

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.720
Inspector, they went back inside.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.840
Follow them.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840
(Explosion)

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.760
- Anybody hurt?
- No, sir.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.520
Wait for my signal.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.000
Go!

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600
(Explosion)

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.760
Go! Go!

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.080
Go!

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.320
Go! Go!

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.800
3 o’clock. Set 2.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.440
Go! Go!

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.480
(Explosion)

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.040
Yai, go!

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.160
Phaya! Tharn! Let’s go!

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.320
Take cover, Yai!

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.600
Go!

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.240
Stop!

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.800
Slow them down. I’ll get on the boat.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.400
Make sure you get there in time.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.200
Yes, sir.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.080
(Gunshot)

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.160
Can’t you guys just leave me alone?!

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.960
I shouldn’t have spared your life.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.920
I should have killed you both just like your father and your brother!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.120
Please cover me.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.520
(Gunshot)

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.320
Khem!

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.480
Khem!

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.200
Khem!

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.520
Khem!

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.960
Khem!

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.800
Khem!

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.240
Khem!

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.880
Stop! Let him go!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.320
You don’t want him to die, do you? Put your gun down!

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.400
I said, put it down!

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.960
You too!

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.360
(Gunshot)

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.640
Bastard!

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.760
Yai, go!

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.599
Go get him, Tharn!

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.680
Stop!

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.120
Do you want to be with your parents so much?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.920
I’m going to send you to live with them soon.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.280
Say hello to them for me too. Tell them I miss them.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.280
What the f***?!

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.080
No! No!

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.400
I don’t want him to die that easily.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.640
I want him to pay for what he did.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.000
Tharn.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.880
Inspector, we found various kinds of drugs in the warehouse
including amphetamine, Ice, and Heroin.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.640
It’s also a hub for processing drugs for concealment to avoid detection during the smuggling.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.000
How are Chart and Khem?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.040
Both of them are safe now.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.440
Tharn.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.960
What happened to Khom and Montree at that abandoned factory?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.280
They both already paid for they did to my dad,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.520
your brother, and the others.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.280
Yeah.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.920
I have a voice clip in which you’re dealing on your drugs business with Kao.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.760
Just confess.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.960
You won’t get away this time.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.680
Then why do you still want to frame me?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.960
If you have any evidence, just show it to me. Where is it?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.280
I don’t want to frame you.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.640
I want you to confess.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.040
And you won’t be going to jail alone.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.040
I’m going to get that person behind you too.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.960
So, you better tell me how that person is.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.800
(Laughing)

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.640
That person behind me?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.280
Why would you want to know?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.120
There is no one behind me!

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.320
Let me tell you this, Inspector.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.240
It’s actually one of your kind who often comes wagging their tails...

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.960
and begging me to help them.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.440
I’m telling you justice, honesty justification they don’t really exist in this world.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.480
Even though you could arrest someone like me,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.720
there’ll always be someone worse than me being born somewhere in this world.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.920
Do you know why?

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.520
Because there are some people who are worse than people like me.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.400
Some people like you lot...

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.640
who always help facilitate those with money and power like me, Inspector.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.880
So, if you have any evidence, just lay it in front of me.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.200
I’m not afraid of you.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.680
Fine.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.640
Then you can look forward to go rotting in jail.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.680
And let me tell you something.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.160
Justice, honesty, and justification

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.440
they do exist.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.440
It’s up to the people who use them.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.560
Um

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.120
Just wait and see.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.760
I’m going to crush these filthy network and put people like you behind bars.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.640
Then do it. Prove it.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.920
You might feel so sure that your power and money can help you to escape the hands of law this time.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.760
But trust me.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.960
You can never escape karma.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.080
Inspector.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.560
Should I take him back to Bangkok?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.800
Did he confess?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.320
People like him won’t confess so easily.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.280
He must think that the person behind him...

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.640
will be able to help him get away with this.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.800
If we can Montree to confess,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.320
Those behind him will surely be in trouble.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.800
There is a recent report from IDF special investigation unit today...

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:52.120
regarding the big raid and arrest at Montree’s drugs warehouse.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.040
Montree will be sentenced to prison for life.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.400
He is involved in many criminal cases including an international drug traffiking.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.160
A recent report also confirms that...

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.120
several high-ranking police officers...

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.000
as well as politicians are also involved in this case.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.200
IDF special investigation unit will reopen the murder cases of many ex-police officers...

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.280
in order to bring back justice for every one of them whose deaths are still shrouded in mystery.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.200
Phaya.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.200
Tharn.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.840
(Crying)
Phaya.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.640
(Crying)
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.840
I’m safe and sound.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.360
- Miss you so much.
- Yai.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.440
Finally, you’ve made it.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.240
- I was so worried. Are you hurt?
- No.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.160
You're as beautiful as you always were.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.120
(Slapping on the arm)
Ouch.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.400
- Did it hurt?
- Ouch.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.840
- Are there cuts or wounds anywhere?
- No.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.560
I thought I’d never see you again.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.480
(Crying)

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.520
Can I not have that spicy chilli paste?

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.000
Can I have you instead?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.560
(Slapping on the shoulder)

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.440
Don’t do this again, Tharn.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.520
You’re the only family I have left.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.000
Without you, I won’t be able to live.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.960
I’m so sorry, Grandma.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.840
But I can finally put the one who killed my parents behind bars.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.960
You’re not the mother of a bad cop.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:57.440
You are a mother of a good cop an honest and law-abiding one.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.320
That’s good, dear.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.760
Your father must be so proud...

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.000
that his son is also a good cop like him.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.680
(Music)

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.240
Now that you’ve caught the killer, your parents must be so happy.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.720
Phaya.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.120
Thank you so much.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.520
For staying by my side.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.040
We’ve been through a lot together.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.720
Thank you so much.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.920
It must be destiny.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.720
Just like what you’ve always wondered...

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.600
how I’m always there to protect you.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.240
Me too.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.280
I will always protect you, Tharn.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.000
Tharn.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.760
You already promised me.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.840
That you will always be by my side.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.200
No matter what might happen tomorrow,

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.120
you must never give up.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.760
You have to fight for us.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.440
And we will get through it together.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.040
Just one more day.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.560
Then you and I...

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.800
will finally be together forever.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.720
I love you.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.719
I love you too.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.000
I always have.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.800
And always will.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.360
(Exciting sound)

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.440
Please feel free to take some fruits.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.080
(Bell jingling)

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.440
Go ahead and take some fruits & desserts.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.920
(Bell jingling)

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480
(Drum roll)

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.800
(Drum roll / Bell jingling)

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.200
(Drum roll / Bell jingling)
(Exciting sound)

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:10.000
(Exciting sound)

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.560
You’re up so early.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.280
Are you preparing the offerings? Do you need any help?

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.240
Oh, it’s already taken care off.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.200
(Exciting sound)

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:07.720
(Exciting sound)

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.920
(Exciting sound)

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.000
Today is an important day.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.760
It’s the day that he will return...

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.440
to Makhong river...

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.720
in order to show off his power and also pay respect to the Buddha in the human world.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.600
I’ve prepared these offerings for him myself,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.480
in hope that the holy spirits and all the merits I have done...

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.760
will help turning a disaster into a blessing.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:40.800
(Exciting sound)

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:28.200
(Praying)

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.200
(Exciting sound)

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:38.200
(Exciting sound)

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:59.000
(Praying)

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.120
Tharn!

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.480
Tharn!

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.760
Tharn!

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.920
Tharn!

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.000
Tharn!

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.560
Tharn! Where are you?!

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.240
Tharn!

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.240
Tharn!

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.160
Have you already taken him away?

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.440
Tharn!

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.760
- What’s going on?
- Grandma

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.080
What’s going on?

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.520
He has taken Tharn away!

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.440
Tharn!

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.200
Tharn!

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Tharn!

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.960
- Grandma!
- Tharn!

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.360
Tharn!

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.440
- Tharn!
- Grandma!

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.400
Where are you going?

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.320
Let me go!

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.800
I am going to find Tharn.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.040
- Tharn
- Where are you going to find him?

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.080
- Phaya
- Grandma!

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.240
Grandma!

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.080
- Hey!
- Tharn!

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.800
Tharn!

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.880
- Tharn! / - Phaya!

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.120
What happened?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.560
Tell me, what happened?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.600
- Abbot!
- Phaya.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.520
Luangpor!

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.920
Luangpor!

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.320
Tharn is gone!

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.280
Luangpor!

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.840
(Crying)

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.400
Tharn! Tharn!

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.920
Hey! Phaya!

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.520
Tharn!

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.600
Tharn!

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.400
Tharn!

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.160
Tharn! Where are you?!

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.520
Tharn!

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.160
Tharn!

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.720
Tharn!

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:38.880
Hey!

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.200
(Jumping into the river)

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360
Tharn!

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.200
Tharn! Where are you?!

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.640
Tharn!

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.840
Tharn!

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.600
Phaya…why did you follow me?

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.600
I already told you.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.720
I’m not going to let you go.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.120
I decided to spare your life.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.360
But you just chose to leave it here.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.160
If you really love Tharn,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.360
you should stop hurting him.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.920
I’m not hurting him,

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.360
I just want to take him back to where he belongs.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.720
To be with someone who can protect him, and love him.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.600
When you said you love him,

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.160
the only person you love is actually yourself.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.360
You did all this for yourself.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.800
You’ve never loved him.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.680
No!

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.640
I love him. I never forgot about him.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.280
Unlike you who couldn’t remember anything.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.520
Without Wanwisa, you wouldn’t have known the truth you wouldn’t have remembered him.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.880
Tharn.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.000
Even if Wanwisa hadn’t told me the truth.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.760
Even if I hadn’t known anything about our past, about who you are.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.960
Even if I hadn't known how much we used to love each other.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.040
Nothing would change.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.600
I still love you.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.920
Just the way you are.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.880
I’m not going to let you go.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.240
I’m not going to make that mistake again.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.680
Tharn.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.160
Come back with me.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.240
Hey!

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.640
(Pushing / Falling)

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.440
Doc, please let him go.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.840
Leave me alone!

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.040
Tharn!

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.240
(Fighting)

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560
(Fighting)

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.480
(Fighting)

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.800
(Fighting)

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.200
(Fighting)

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.200
(Fighting)

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.840
(Fighting)

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.640
Ouch!

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.680
(Roaring)

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.520
(Roaring)

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.840
Without you, everything would have been over by now!

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.760
(Fighting)

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.120
No!

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.840
Help!

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.920
- Hey! / - No

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.720
Tharn!

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.080
Tharn!

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.240
Tharn.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.400
Tharn.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.480
Tharn.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.880
Tharn.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.600
Tharn.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.320
He has always sacrificed himself for you.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.080
But all you do is trying to keep him where he doesn’t belong.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.960
You are selfish.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.560
No, Tharn.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.080
Stay with me, Tharn.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.120
You have to come with me.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.720
Tharn.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.680
Please stop killing each other.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.720
I’m begging you both for one last time.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.480
(Crying in pain)

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.440
Tharn.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.000
Tharn.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.360
Tharn.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.560
- Tharn. / - Tharn.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.800
Tharn.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.240
He must go back to the Naga cave.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.600
It’s the only way to save him.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.520
Stop being selfish and let him go.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.720
No. No.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.880
Tharn.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.280
(Pushing)
Arghhh!

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.160
Arghhh!

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.800
Tharn!

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.320
Tharn!

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.160
Tharn!

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.360
(Crying)

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.960
No!

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.480
Tharn!

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.560
Tharn!

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.040
Tharn!

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.480
Tharn!

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.080
Phaya, you’re back, dear.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.160
Phaya.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.640
Why am I here?

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.760
You were drowned.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.480
You were unconcious for 4 days.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.280
I thought I had lost you forever.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.760
I went looking for Tharn.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.320
Have you found him?

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.240
Has anyone found him, Grandma?

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.680
Tharn, he...he disappeared.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.240
He’s disappeared since the day he was taken away.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.960
No one has found his body yet.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.640
Where are you going?

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.040
- I’ll go looking for Tharn.
- Phaya!

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.240
I’ll find him. I know where he is.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.520
Chalothorn has him. I have to go help Tharn.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.280
Where is it then?

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.200
In Makhong river. Let me go.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.800
(Crying)
Phaya.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.120
- Let me go. / - Phaya.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120
Phaya.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.000
Let me go!

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.600
Phaya!

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.360
Get yourself together!

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.000
Tharn is gone!

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.880
He’s not with us anymore.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.640
Don’t you get it?

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.040
(Crying)

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040
Grandma

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.120
(Crying)

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.960
- Grandma
- Please try to get over it.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.160
(Crying)

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.240
Tharn is not going to be with us anymore.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.520
(Crying)

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.240
(Crying)
Tharn.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.280
(Crying)

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.720
Tharn.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.160
Tharn.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.400
(Crying)

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.520
(Crying)

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.480
[ Dao: Nee, how’s the situation there? ]

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.880
Phaya has already come to.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.560
But...

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.400
Tharn has disappeared.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.120
Everyone here is so worried.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.640
[ Dao: Is Grandma okay? ]

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.600
Well, sort of.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.200
How are you? Is everything okay there in France?

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.360
[ Dao: Things are almost already in place once I’ve arrived. ]

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.880
[ Dao: Please send my best regards to Grandma and Phaya too. ]

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.200
Okay.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.720
- Nee. / - Yes?

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.320
[ Dao: Please stay strong. ]

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.240
[ Dao: You have to take care of both Phaya and Grandma right now. ]

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.120
[ Dao: I’m worried about you. ]

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.920
Okay.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.760
[ Dao: I’ll call you again later. ]

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.120
Okay.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.080
Paranee.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.760
Phaya has already come to.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.240
Here, take it.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.560
Why?

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.880
Just take it.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:39.960
🎵Making me know that what we have has made you walked away🎵
It will help protect you.
Until next time, we’ll meet again.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:51.320
🎵I never want it to be like this. I also have a heart🎵
Do you remember the first time we met at the camp? You know what?

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.280
🎵A heart that’s only for you🎵
I really want to hug you right now.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:09.520
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:18.880
🎵Or should I disappear?🎵
You don’t want me to stay away from water. Then can I stay close to you instead?

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:26.360
🎵No more that person who always has to watch you walk away🎵

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:35.200
🎵Or am I the one who should leave? No more tears from now on🎵
Do you believe in past lives and reincarnation?

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.760
🎵No more those time we could spend together🎵
I do.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:51.280
🎵You and me, it’s over now🎵
Then I’ll do anything so that I could stay by your side.

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.160
I’m not going anywhere.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.640
I’ll stay close to you.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:12.000
🎵It’s over now, isn’t it🎵
I’ll do everything so that you won’t feel sorry or lose me. I promise.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:31.320
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.080
Has anyone found him yet?

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.960
Maybe, you should take leave for a while.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.760
Once you’re ready, you can get back to work.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.680
About Tharn.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.440
I’ve asked every officer and authority involved to help search for him day and night.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.160
I truly hope we’ll hear something from them soon.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720
Baby and I took a week off from work.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.720
We’ll help you look for Tharn.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.080
Wherever you’re going,

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.800
we’ll go with you.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:01.080
Phaya, do you know that today is the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.280
The elders here believe that on this day...

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.320
the Nagas will disguise themselves as human.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.720
Maybe, they might come to help looking for Tharn.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.360
Yeah, so when the first fire ball appears,

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.640
we’d wish for you to finally find Tharn.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.280
Are you going to spend the rest of your life like this...

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.240
if you can’t find him in this life?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.040
Phaya

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.600
There are still lots of work at the unit waiting for you to take care of.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.920
And I don’t think Tharn would want to see you in this state.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.720
I’m sorry, sir.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.960
(Music)

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.480
Phaya.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.920
Tharn.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.240
(Music)

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.120
Tharn.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.600
(Music)

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.120
You are back.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.440
(Crying)

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.680
It’s really you.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.120
You came back to me.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.760
Yes, it’s me.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800
(Crying)

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.560
Since that day,

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.760
Chalothorn took me back...

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.560
and tried to save my life.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.240
He gave me his Naga soul so that I’d live.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.960
Then why didn’t you come back earlier?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.480
Do you know how much I really miss you?

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880
I do.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.840
But I feel bad for Chalothorn. I wanted to look after him.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.520
And wanted him to truly let me go.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.920
I did everything I could…

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.280
to make him understand about us.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.920
So that he would stop making us apart.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.640
And...did he get it now?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.760
He’s not going to take you away from me again, is he?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.120
Yes.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.360
He’s the one who sends me here today.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.320
He wants me to be with you.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.920
Please don’t worry.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.720
I will take care of him.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.760
And will always love him.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.160
You’re not going to leave me again, are you?

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:09.960
Do you know…

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.680
that during the time you were gone,

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.080
how badly I wanted to see you?

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.360
- I miss you so much.
- Say no more, Phaya.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.279

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.920
(Exciting sound)

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.640
Long time no see.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.600
Sakunanopparuj.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.120
How do you know my name?
