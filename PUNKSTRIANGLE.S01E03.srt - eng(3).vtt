WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(Sumiura Residence - 13th)

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:38.000
"Okay, let's meet at 10 PM.
Tokyo, LET IT HEAVEN Bar."

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.958
LET IT HEAVEN

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:48.125
What kind of bar is it?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.917
"What should I order at
a bar for the first time?"

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:59.208
"First time at a bar, how do you
order a drink without looking like a fool?"

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.208
"How do I even order a drink?"

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:09.542
Hmm... preferences?

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:13.333
Even if you ask me what I like,
I wouldn't know what to say.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.417
Oh, right! What do I wear?!

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.042
This is the one.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.417
And...

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.417
"PUNKSâ–³TRIANGLE"
(Episode 3)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.708
Is this...

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.542
The right place?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.667
Chiaki.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.000
Over here.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.833
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.000
Of course.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:47.792
What do you want to drink?

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.917
Um...

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.083
You don't drink much, do you?

00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.500
A cocktail like a Kitty goes down easy.

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.625
I'll have that, then.

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.875
One Kitty for him, please.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.542
Right away.

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:18.458
Your bag...

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.042
Sorry.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:26.458
You like this brand?

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:30.333
Yeah! Three years ago at TBC Fashion Week,

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.958
AE wore it on the runway.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:36.292
I was a total nobody back then.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:40.292
That's when I saw AE's look,

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:43.375
and I fell in love with this style.

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.792
Is this because of me too?

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.083
Huh?

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:51.667
The lip ring.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I see.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:06.167
It's... kind of hot.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.458
I... I've always thought so.

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:14.625
AE, you're just so captivating.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:17.542
Here you are.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.333
One Kitty.

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:28.833
AE... is this look
purely your personal style?

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:34.458
Well... at first, it was kind of
to ward off unwanted attention.

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:38.458
For some reason,
I was pretty popular in middle school.

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:45.875
So in high school, I started
getting piercings, dyeing my hair...

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.458
Once I put the whole look together,
people stopped approaching me.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.708
And more importantly,

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:56.167
I felt like I'd become a
totally different person.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.875
That's when I realized
how fun fashion could be.

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:08.250
Is that why you became a model?

00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:14.167
Nah, I bought so many clothes
that I went broke and got scouted.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:18.875
Honestly, I only became a model
to make money to buy more clothes.

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:22.542
Oh, so that's how it was.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.333
Am I disappointing you?

00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.167
Huh?

00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:32.583
A lot of people have this
preconceived notion of the "AE" persona.

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:36.417
I just hope I didn't ruin the
image you had in your head.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:40.292
Not at all. I love watching
you on the runway.

00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:43.537
And your gaze... It just makes you seem
more approachable. I like it even more.

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:51.708
I'm just so happy to hear
these little stories from my bias.

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.667
Oh my god, why did I just say
something so embarrassing?

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:10.125
So you... like my gaze, huh?

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.000
AE... that's not fair.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.750
Sorry, I was just messing with you.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:34.500
Yeah.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:37.333
So, how is it? Do you like it?

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:42.167
Yeah, it's sweet, and...

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:46.667
The way the light
hits it... it's beautiful.

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.208
So, once you finish
that, shall we head out?

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.833
Experience the nightlife.

00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.250
Huh?

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:03.125
There's a secret rave tonight.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.000
A secret... rave?

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:10.500
Is that... like one of those...

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:17.042
The location and time are unlisted.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.042
It's at some old abandoned factory.

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:24.333
You can only get in if you're with
someone who knows, or by word of mouth.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:28.125
It goes all night until dawn. It's awesome.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.875
So a world like this actually exists...

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.917
Here, your drink.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.208
Thanks.

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:12.458
Whoa, that's strong.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.000
You okay?

00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:16.492
- Yeah.
- AE? It really is AE!

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.458
No way!

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:20.625
Oh my god...

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.934
He's even more handsome in person...

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.208
Are you here with a friend?

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:24.375
I'm so glad.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.667
Excuse me.

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:29.750
Why am I...

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.250
Let's go, Chiaki.

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:40.333
Huh?

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:53.542
Right now, AE...

00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:57.417
is all mine.

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.500
We should be safe here.

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:56.542
This song...

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:01.458
I love it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.333
I never knew AE had this side to him.

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:21.458
Ah, this is amazing!

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.542
He's so cool even when
he's just having fun...

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:35.250
Chiaki, don't be so stiff.

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:36.875
Aren't you gonna dance?

00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:42.375
I... I'm really not a dancer...

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.500
You don't have to be so serious.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:51.958
Just feel the beat and
sway your body, like this.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.250
Yeah...

00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.667
Just let the music take over.

00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:04.208
That's it.

00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:11.917
When you're feeling it, try taking a sip.

00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:19.417
Ah...

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:20.875
Tastes good, right?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.708
It really does! Why is that?

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:26.250
Who knows?

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:41.708
AE taught me everything.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.333
How to have fun at a club,

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:49.333
the taste of alcohol, how to smoke,

00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:51.458
how to enjoy the nightlife.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.833
And the thrill of so many firsts...

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:21.125
Chiaki, you're pretty drunk. You okay?

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:23.292
This is so fun!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.250
Actually, I went out last night, too.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.625
Where'd you go?

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.083
The same place I met you, AE.

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:38.875
It was awesome.

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:44.167
We just drew all over the
place and made a huge mess.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.458
Did you have fun?

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.458
It was so much fun.

00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:01.250
Which did you like better, then or now?

00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:06.042
Hmm...

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:10.750
I loved both nights out.

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:23.375
AE's fingers are so cool...

00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:32.500
Chiaki, you're so cute.

00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:35.458
Huh?

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:50.042
I feel sick.

00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:56.000
Are you okay?

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.792
Never been better!

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:11.083
I'm sorry. I should've stopped
you from drinking so much.

00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:13.958
But why? It was so good...

00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:17.250
Even if it's good, it's still alcohol.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.000
But I did everything you said.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.417
You'd get drunk either way.

00:15:21.542 --> 00:15:25.125
Come on, just let it
out. You'll feel better.

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:30.250
I can't.

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:35.534
Forcing yourself to puke all
the time... isn't good for you.

00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.333
Forgive me.

00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:47.667
Relax...

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.375
That's it.

00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:55.333
Your fingers... they're so warm.

00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:03.625
The ring is cool.

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:12.000
Chiaki, your mouth is so hot.

00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:16.208
The ring?

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:18.208
AE's fingers?

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.292
A part of AE is inside me.

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:29.250
Chiaki... what's with
that look on your face?

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.292
Good. I'm glad you got it out.

00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.583
It's the scent of AE's cigarettes.

00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:07.375
Like black tea mixed with vanilla...

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:12.708
Awake?

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.667
AE!

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.208
Huh?

00:17:18.792 --> 00:17:20.333
Was it a dream?

00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:22.333
You seem okay. That's good.

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.625
Huh? What was I...

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.625
It feels good.

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:47.250
It really does.

00:18:00.042 --> 00:18:01.583
A cigarette.

00:18:01.708 --> 00:18:03.000
Hmm?

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:09.292
Can I have one, too?

00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.125
What, you're hooked now?

00:18:19.292 --> 00:18:20.750
I guess so.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.500
I think I'm hooked.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:59.875
Chiaki... is there someone
you like right now?

00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:07.583
I know who that is.

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:10.458
Oh, you do?

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.208
I do.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.125
I'm not asking about who you look up to.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.875
I mean, do you have a type?

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:25.208
Well...

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.417
I do.

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:32.167
What kind of person?

00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:38.958
Someone who doesn't keep secrets.

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:54.458
I see.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.042
My memory of that night is always so hazy.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.917
I can't remember what
AE and I talked about,

00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:14.083
or how I got home.

00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:18.167
I can barely remember a thing.

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:34.833
Let's go, Chiaki.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.375
Huh?

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:03.125
"Thanks for yesterday. I had a lot of fun."

00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:16.083
"I don't remember anything after a certain
point. Did I cause you any trouble? I'm sorry."

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.208
"If it's okay,
I'd like to apologize in person."

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.500
That was the last one.

00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.125
Since that day...

00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:44.250
Was it because of what I sent?

00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:48.250
AE stopped replying to my messages.

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:54.083
Sumiura, why don't you go take a break?

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:57.125
Sumiura?

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:00.500
Hey, Sumiura?

00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:02.125
Yes!

00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:05.958
Go take a break.

00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:09.333
Thanks.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:17.750
Manager, what's up with Sumiura?

00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:24.292
He has night classes.

00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.875
He's probably rushing to
finish a paper. He has a lot due.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.958
I see.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.292
He's really pushing himself.

00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:42.991
I'm not asking who you admire.

00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:46.667
I'm asking what your type is.

00:22:47.167 --> 00:22:47.958
I do.

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:49.375
What kind of person?

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:58.292
Someone who doesn't keep secrets.

00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:06.667
If he were to find out...

00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:12.583
that I'm AE...

00:23:12.699 --> 00:23:14.366
I'm afraid it would be over.

00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:29.000
Did I do something wrong?

00:23:32.042 --> 00:23:35.042
Did I do something to make him mad?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.167
What should I do?

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.167
What in the world am I supposed to do...?

00:23:49.542 --> 00:23:50.851
(Next time on...)
I'm in love with Chiaki.

00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:52.208
But I'll never tell him.

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.625
My only choice...

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.042
is to win the championship.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.458
Why not go with punk?

00:23:56.583 --> 00:23:57.292
Will you be there?

00:23:57.417 --> 00:23:59.750
Have you heard? AE's piercing is gone.
