WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.520
Should I call you Qu Bai now

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.240
or what?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.460
After the Riverbank Case on the 14th,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.660
I finally realized

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.960
that you were the boy from her memories.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.560
Captain Luo,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.400
from the first time

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.320
we met, I knew

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.760
no matter how well I hid,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.560
I would eventually meet you at the end of the road.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.320
So you're also part of Old K's criminal organization.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.650
Helping us solve cases,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.520
helping us catch criminals,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
even saving my life at Yu Ji's place.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.410
It was all part of your plan, wasn't it?

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.539
Right and wrong exist in one's heart.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.039
I have nothing to explain.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Fine.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.690
Let's put aside what happened before.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.010
But you and Chi Xia are on different paths now.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.520
Have you decided what to choose?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.360
Sometimes choices aren't ours to make.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.400
But I will keep my distance from Chi Xia.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.300
However, Captain Luo should understand

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.780
that I'm doing this

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.120
not because I fear you.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.480
Qu Bai,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.360
listen carefully.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.720
What I'm telling you now

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.200
isn't for my sake.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.079
It's for Chi Xia.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
You're the most important person in her memories.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.079
I don't want your wrong choices

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.880
to cause her such pain

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.079
and suffering again.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.920
Whether you choose right or wrong,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.050
it's your decision.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.340
Though I don't have evidence now,

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.360
but if in the past

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.850
or in the future,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.180
you commit a crime,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.900
I will catch you with my own hands.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.840
These are Chixia's favorite

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.320
lychee candy recipe.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.320
Please take good care of her for me.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.520
This is a shared memory between you two.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.200
It has nothing to do with me.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.260
I won't interfere.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.120
She's my team member now.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.940
I'll naturally take good care of her.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.500
No need for your reminder.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.420
Stay on the right path.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.480
Here it comes.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.240
Still at the crossroads.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.050
I don't particularly like this scene.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.360
But I do like this scene.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.240
can bring me.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.000
Haven't you always wondered

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.810
why I insist on Chixia recovering her memory?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.860
I've been keeping it from you.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.800
But now

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.360
it's time to tell you.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.640
Do you remember Zhou Nan?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.680
That chemistry genius from the base.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.280
I remember.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.840
Seventeen years ago,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.140
to break into the drug market,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640
I had Zhou Nan develop

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.440
a zombie drug with 92% purity.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.920
But it was ruined by that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.580
undercover cop named Fu Gang.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.960
Fu Gang took the formula with him,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.240
along with Zhou Nan and Chi Xia.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.920
As for Zhou Nan,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.720
he was killed by that idiot who worked for us.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.920
You remember, right?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.040
I do.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.370
Before Fu Gang died,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.000
I deduced from what he deliberately avoided saying

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.760
that he put the paper formula in a coded box

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.480
and hid it somewhere.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.720
And Chi Xia, who successfully escaped,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.280
became the only person

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.300
who might know about the formula.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.760
It took me a full ten years to find her.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.080
But

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.160
her adoptive father Lin Yushan, a psychology professor,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.600
had actually sealed

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.440
all her memories

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.440
through hypnosis.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.640
But where there's a will, there's a way.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.120
I had someone approach Lin Yushan as a student

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.890
and discovered that

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.180
in Chi Xia's original therapy notebook,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.650
there were some numbers written down.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.380
I remember a sequence of numbers.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.420
It includes but is not limited to these numbers,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480
besides 12,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.840
14, and 25.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.360
There are also 1 and 2.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.960
Are you saying

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.170
that the numbers appearing in previous cases

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.400
have appeared in your memory before?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.460
Not just appeared,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.960
but left a very deep impression.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.640
This was told to me by Fu Gang,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.560
a police officer who went undercover

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.640
at the Lawa Zhai criminal base years ago.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.770
I can't run anymore.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.570
I can't run anymore.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.680
Calm down.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.440
I'm begging you.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.640
If you want to escape,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.880
don't take me with you.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.760
Shut up.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.320
Chi Xia.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.400
Uncle will tell you a series of numbers.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.930
They represent a location.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.600
25.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.880
14.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.159
12.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.159
14.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.880
25.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.920
25.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.400
12.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.159
Remember their order.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600
Give it to Jinzi.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.380
This series of numbers

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.640
[Computer wallpaper 25]

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.970
represents a location.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.400
There's a formula for a high-purity drug hidden there,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.760
methcathinone.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.880
Also, Fu Gang has been undercover for years

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.480
and has gathered partial evidence of Old K's crimes.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.540
Unfortunately...

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.120
Knowing the numbers is useless.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.360
I have no idea how to decode them.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.290
If I can get the complete sequence,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.880
I can find where Fu Gang hid the formula.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.520
Back then,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.400
the Lin couple wanted to protect Chi Xia,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.220
and refused to awaken her memories at all costs.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.480
So,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360
you arranged hitmen

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.080
to make it look like an accident

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.539
and killed the Lin couple.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.840
Two years ago,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.450
Chi Xia encountered a case of vigilante justice,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.580
which caused her memories

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.260
to start resurfacing.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.600
So you had Chi Xiao manipulate those killers

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.300
to take justice into their own hands.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.640
Yes.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.320
It was a heaven-sent opportunity.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.760
The murderer Tu Guo'an

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.200
was sent back to Dongzhou under my orders.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.600
Two years was enough time

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.840
for us to orchestrate several vigilante cases.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.200
I guess.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.080
These recent cases

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.920
have been constantly triggering my memory recovery

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.360
were actually planned by

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.720
Old K to retrieve the formula and criminal evidence

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.180
through targeted crimes.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.480
[Methcathinone]

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.400
Now that it's banned domestically,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.930
manufacturers will certainly move operations abroad.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.000
For me, this

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.130
is the biggest business opportunity.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.960
We can use this chance

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.810
to build a production base.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.680
Our group only appears prosperous

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.940
but we're actually losing money.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.180
If this continues,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.040
we'll be at a dead end.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.560
The Kotter Group

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.080
is very satisfied with our high-purity samples.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.800
Last month,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.760
I secured an order with them.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.360
Now we just need the formula.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.840
Once we get the formula,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.040
we can immediately begin

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.560
mass production

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.290
and complete the delivery.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.600
Is it that multinational Kotter Group?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.520
Why such urgency?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.600
What happens if

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560
we can't deliver?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.760
The Kotter Group

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.640
is not someone we can afford to offend.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.440
But

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.210
let's take a gamble.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.810
The delivery date is the 8th of next month.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.680
If we deliver successfully,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.440
our group

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.410
will get a new lease on life.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.640
If we fail to deliver,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.040
then I,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.200
you,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.400
all of us

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.380
will be completely finished.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.760
Don't worry about the coded box,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.760
but as for the location array...

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.320
I know

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.400
you and Chi Xia are close,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.160
like siblings, right?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.160
So

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.960
you need to pay attention

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.160
to what matters.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920
Don't worry.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.880
Go now.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.680
Give Mo Laoqi a message.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.440
Okay.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.760
Also,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.320
Yang Zhiming's son, who has been my stand-in for all these years,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.360
is coming back to China.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.620
He's devoted so much time to the company.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.740
It's about time

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.980
for father and son to reunite.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.320
Well,

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.520
Zhiming is a smart man.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.880
He knows what to do.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.040
All right.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.880
Actually, shortly after the fire incident

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.540
Mr. Chang mentioned something to me.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.440
He said there was a foreign criminal organization

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.400
that had already infiltrated Dongzhou.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.360
And it has caught the serious attention of the provincial department.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.620
Combined with what you've told me today,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.970
I think the current situation is extremely serious.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.770
I'll relay this to Chang

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.170
so he can report it to the provincial department.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.900
After you escaped from Lawazhai,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.620
have you seen any gold?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.040
After returning to the country,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.320
I tried to find him,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.520
but couldn't.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.000
To be honest,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.140
from the moment I escaped from Lawa Village,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.720
I've been constantly on edge.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.560
I was so afraid.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.560
I was afraid they would find me

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.820
and take me back there.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.580
Even though my parents adopted me later,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.320
and were so good to me,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600
I still couldn't fully trust them.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.040
As time went on,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.650
my mental state collapsed.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.880
My parents felt sorry for me,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.760
seeing that I couldn't even sleep well.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.200
So during one psychological counseling session,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.560
they used hypnosis

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.420
to block all my memories before the age of 12.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.600
Captain Luo,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.920
As a relative,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.160
I'm requesting to recuse myself from my parents' case.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.000
And my connection with the K Group

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.860
is complicated and difficult to explain right now.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.520
So I'm earnestly asking you

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.690
to make sure the suspects are brought to justice.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.400
Don't worry.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.480
I'll pay close attention to your adoptive parents' case

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.340
and submit your recusal request.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.360
However,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.080
I'll also submit a request

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.760
to have you involved in the investigation.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.800
Your knowledge about the K Group

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.960
would be extremely helpful for solving this case.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.040
But,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.300
I'll submit it,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.760
and it's up to the leadership to decide.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.330
Thank you, Captain Luo.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.960
Do you have

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.340
any other impressions

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560
of Comrade Fu Gang?

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.560
My impression of him is very strong.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.680
When I arrived in Lawa Village at eight years old,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.640
I met him.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.920
Back then, I thought

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.040
he was no different

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.740
from the other criminals.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.240
Thank you, Uncle Fu Gang.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.730
But later I gradually realized

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.700
that he wasn't actually a cold-hearted person.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.680
But how could someone from a criminal organization

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.240
have any humanity?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.600
He would secretly help me

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.720
when I failed to pass the tests.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.840
He privately pleaded with other instructors for me

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.640
to spare me from the painful hypnotic punishment.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.890
Then what happened?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.600
Later,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.920
I got my own code name.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.200
Fox.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.360
But I don't know why after I left,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.120
this code name was adopted by Chi Xiao.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.000
Maybe that's why

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.120
whenever I hear the word 'Fox'

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.400
or see the fox symbol,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.360
it feels so familiar.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.320
You're not Fox.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.560
You never were.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.800
You never belonged with them.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.360
Forget about their damn code names.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.800
You're not like them.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.880
He told me the same thing.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.760
Maybe I was different from

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.640
the other children in the village.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.120
Because I always wanted to escape.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.120
So he thought there was still hope for me.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.450
He thought I wasn't completely deranged.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.980
That I wasn't fully brainwashed.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.680
So...

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.920
When did you first realize

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.460
Comrade Fu Gang was a police officer?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.700
Because he was always helping me,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
so I started watching him secretly.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.800
One time,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.400
he went to steal documents from the chemistry lab.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.840
I happened to be there too,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.640
but he didn't notice me.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.740
From that moment, I started thinking

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.810
that he might not be from Lawazhai,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.360
that he might not be a bad person.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.970
He had such a profound impact on me.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.839
Actually, everyone in the group

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.140
had quite a complicated background.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.819
But he treated everyone equally.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.680
If we were on a mission together,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.000
in life-or-death situations,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.359
he would step forward

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.160
and risk his life to save others.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.920
I once asked him why.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.680
Why do you save them?

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.520
What?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.960
Aren't you a police officer?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.080
Those people all have blood on their hands.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Isn't it said that killers should pay with their lives?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.440
Why do you save them?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.560
Why don't you just

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.840
kill them directly?

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.250
Police officers

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.240
are defenders of the law,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.200
not executioners of vigilante justice.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.560
Before they are legally convicted,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.420
they are all living human beings.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.920
Disregarding life

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.640
is not what Chinese police

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.880
should stand for.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.410
Perhaps it was words like these

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.900
and this kind of character

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.240
that gradually influenced my entire life.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.760
Even though I lost my memory,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.120
something subconsciously guided me to apply for police academy

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.380
and become an excellent police officer.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.840
In such extreme circumstances,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920
Comrade Fu Gang

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.570
could still demonstrate firm beliefs

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.200
and excellent character to inspire the next generation.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200
Truly admirable.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.960
What he left you

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.900
is a series of numbers.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.200
This array contains information about a location.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.760
I guess

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.160
there must be a master key

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.330
that can decode these numbers.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.040
But this master key

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.620
isn't a standard decryption method.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.720
Just guessing won't help us.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.960
I'll request

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.560
Old Chang to help us look into

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.320
Comrade Fu Gang's specific information before he went undercover.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.520
Let's see if we can crack the master key.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.400
Or perhaps

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.040
find Jin Zi.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.320
This way,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.320
we can locate that place.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.000
Good.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.680
Alright.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.480
I understand.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.600
Let's go.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.260
Tu Guolin is awake.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.360
What happened to your foster parents

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.620
was done by my brother.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.440
The meaning of accident

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.240
is accidental death.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.000
You know which side you're on now.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.200
So someone has to take

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.580
the blame for this.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.240
You're a police officer.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.500
You can't kill people.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.360
Then thank you for paving the way

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.560
for my first-class merit.
