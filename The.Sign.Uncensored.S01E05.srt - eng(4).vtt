00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.840
A man wearing a mask, a hat and a hoody.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.680
Exactly the man that Miss Meena had described.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.320
Get down!
(Screaming)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.480
We’ve got one suspect.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.360
His name is Narong, a forensic officer.
I’ve checked the access record.
He had accessed to the case files on rapes and sexual assault in the past month.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.800
He’s not running away.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.720
He’s going to finish his job on his last victim.
That is Songyod.
Can I tag along too?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.800
- Of course.
- No.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
When you imagine something has happened...

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.080
when in fact it never happened at all.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.200
Did Tharn tell you about me?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.440

The Sign

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:35.920
Yes, sir.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.520
I’ll get it done as soon as possible.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.560
Thongthai and Kem. Come with me to see Mr. Songyod.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.960
Singh, you stay here.
Try to track down Narong’s phone
and check all the CCTV cameras on every route that he takes.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.040
Find out where he had been since the last day he came to work.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.079
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to Narong’s house near Suvannabhumi airport.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.760
We might find a cellar there.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360
Let’s get to work.
Yes, sir.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.680
We’re going after the culprit.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.880
If you guys are still mad at each other like this, it might ruin the work.
Go and clear it up with him first.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.560
Phaya.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.760
Phaya!

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.000
Phaya, wait!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.760
I’ve never told Doc about your dream.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.360
Then how did he know?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.520
I’ll ask him how he knew about it.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.240
Then what? It wouldn’t make anything better.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.840
Because you...

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.400
already betrayed me.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.520
I never betrayed you.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.160
Shut up! I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
Hey!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.800
I don’t want you to misunderstand me.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.040
If you think I’m nuts, then leave me alone.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.920
Damn it! That’s too much!

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.800
It’s okay.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.120
Let’s go.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.600
(Door opening)

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.080
Guys.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080
Look.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.000
(Thrill Sound)

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.040
It’s really him.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.000
What a psycho.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.560
He planned everything for his revenge.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.440
But all those cases have nothing to do with his sister.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.880
Why did he do it then?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.680
It’s a sign from someone who used to be a victim.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.159
For what?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.240
To retaliate.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.280
Like the laws in the past.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.640
An eye for an eye (and a tooth for a tooth.)

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.080
Those victims were tortured – whip lashing and hung by the neck. Their tongues...

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.920
and genital organs got cut off and finally they were shot in the head.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.400
We’re at Narong’s place right now.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.440
We’ve found evidence that he is the real culprit.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.600
But there’s still no sign of Narong.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.159
He might know that we’d be coming and probably ran away before we arrived.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.560
How is it going over there?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.720
What?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.000
Okay. See you at the office.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.760
Songyod is at our office right now.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.520
Let’s gather all the evidence and go back there.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.680
- Okay.
- Um

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.240
(Door opening)

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.120
Hey!

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.760
Yai! What happened?!
Stop!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.920
Shit! Why are there two of them?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.720
- Follow him!
- Okay

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.240
Stop!

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.080
Stop!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.800
Stop right now!

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.920
I said stop!

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.120
Stop!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.680
Stop! Stop right now!

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920
Where did he go?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.800
Stop!

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.080
Shit!

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.400
Damn it!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440
Stop!

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.320
Get up!

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.320
Get up!

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.240
You have the right to remain silent...

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.480
What the fuck are you babbling about?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.360
Wit!

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.280
You’re wasting my time, Inspector.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.480
When will you let me go?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.080
I recommend you to cooperate with us and stay here for a while.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.960
It’s for the sake of your own safety.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.080
The man who wants to attack you is sitll on the loose.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.880
Then go get him.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.400
Your salaries are paid from the taxes we pay.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.040
So, you’d better work hard.
Don’t just be a guarding dog...

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.240
Oops, I mean a security guard who’s keeping watch on my every move.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.400
This man wants to hurt you...

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.680
because you raped his younger sister.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.680
So, you’d better be careful. Or else you might end up as the next dead body.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.640
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.600
My client is an innocent man.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.640
Please keep in mind why Mr. Songyod has to be here.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.880
He’s here as a prospect who might fall victim to the culprit.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.160
I don’t understand why you keep trying to incriminate my client.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.000
Are you sure?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.120
I’ve looked at the record. It seems you’ve had a lot of charges filing against you.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.080
Khem.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.840
He actually has a lot of cases.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.480
I admire you and your team for your fast and effiecient work.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.120
And I’m greatly honoured to receive a protection from your team…

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.400
as an innocent man.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.720
Okay then.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.240
But let me warn you about something.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.480
You’d better watch out and lay low during these days.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.800
You’re the culprit’s real target -- the victim that he wants to kill the most.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.080
Then I hope you and your team...

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.400
will catch this culprit soon so that I can finally feel at ease.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.000
Please let me know if you need anything.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.080
I’d be more than willing to help.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.520
Yes, sir.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.400
Thank you very much, sir. Everything went well.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.520
Once I’m done with my business at the safe house...

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.960
please allow me to treat you to a meal.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.720
Tharn, let’s go.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.960
Mr. Songyod, please say something.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.280
Please say something.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:15:01.440
What made you do it?
Why did you do it?
Listen up, everyone.
Please allow me to explain.
My client only came here to provide some information to the police...
so that they could use it to catch the culprit.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.600
But is it true that you were once sued with the charge of sexual assault?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:18.560
- Is it true, Mr. Songyod?
- Is it true?
- Is it true?
Excuse me?
We refuse to answer any questions that are not related to this case.
I’m afraid there’s nothing much I could tell you today.
It might jeopardize the authority’s investigation on the case.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.600
But I’m so thankful to the special investigation unit...

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.000
for their quick and effective work.
They really make me feel safe.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.040
As an innocent man, I feel so grateful to them.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.640
Let’s go!

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.400
Block them.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.200
Go, go!
Where are you going?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.080
Go!

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.480
- Mr. Songyod!
- Please wait!

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.640
We almost got him at Narong’s place.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.200
It was my fault that he got away.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.760
We’re checking the CCTV cameras to track down the car and his escape route.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.840
It’s all right.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.320
Singh, what have you got?

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040
I’ve hacked into the system...

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.920
and found out that Wit is the boyfriend of Rin, Narong’s younger sister who had killed herself.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.400
I think Wit is probably helping the culprit.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.200
He gave Narong a tip-off and kept informing him about our investigation.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.400
I’m afraid Wit is not going to say anything.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.680
He probably wants Narong to finish his job.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.839
Drive me to the safe house. I’m going to clean up a bit.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.599
Also, call the agent and tell them to send me those girls to kill my time.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.440
Geez, those assholes. Now my suit stinks.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.400
(Tap Sound)

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.560
What’s that sound?

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.080
Hey, why did you stop?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.840
(Someone calling for help.)

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.360
Shit! What’s going on?!

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.520
Ouch!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.640
(Sad Music)

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.760
Rin.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.040
Why did you do this to me?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.760
(Crying)

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.880
(Crying)

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.800
(Crying)

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.600
Rin.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.760
(Crying)

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.600
Rin.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.160
Inspector, the security guard at the entrance said that...

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.400
there’s a car without a license plate parked not for away from our unit.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.040
The description matches with the one Narong uses to escape and commit a crime.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.720
Inspector.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.560
- Singh, check the CCTV cameras at the front.
- Yes, sir.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.480
- Khem and Thongthai. Try to find the connection.
- Yes, sir.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.080
Mayris, go and look at the case files.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.440
The one we were looking at yesterday.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.080
(Messaging Sound)

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.720
- Found it?
- Yes, I found it.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.600
Look here

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.560
- Inspector.
- Yes?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440
Damn it!

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.200
- Phaya!
- Phaya!

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.040
Let him go.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.800
Did you give Narong a tip-off on our investigation?

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.800
That’s why he could always get away from us.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.960
Is this what you and him have planned all along?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.920
If you really want to help the victim.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.120
If you want to make it right.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.600
You have to let him pay for what he did to Rin. You have to let him die.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.880
Why would you help him?

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.480
Because I’m a cop!

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.680
Not even you or Narong has any rights to do this to anyone.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.640
But those bastards can do it to other people?

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.760
Rin took her own life because of him.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.200
Many people’s lives are ruined because of a fucking bastard like him.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.360
The one who should be arrested is not me, but him!

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.640
This is why I have to get my hands dirty and do what you people are supposed to do.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.520
This is what he deserves.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.400
Whether he deserves it or not is not your job to decide. The laws will do it.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.720
Narong and I only called out for those people who deserve a better justice.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.840
Can’t you see how many people agree with me?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.880
(Riots)

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.800
(Thrill Sound)

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.440
- Look into those paper again.
- Tharn, what else did you see?

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.760
What else did you see yesterday? Tharn!

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.360
Geez.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.760
Inspector, we don’t have any time left.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.680
Let’s go get him!

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.680
Singh, show us pictures from the CCTV at the crime scene.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.200
- I’m trying.
- These are all we’ve got.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200
Hurry up.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.320
Show me again.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.520
(Airplane Sound)

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.320
Why do you want from me?

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.680
Do you remember me?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.280
No.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.440
If you want to stay alive, you’d better let me go.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.560
Ouch!

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.800
If you can’t remember me,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.960
what about this girl? Do you remember her?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.040
No.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.720
No?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.640
Don't you remember her?

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.760
She’s the girl you raped.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.760
(Someone panting)

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Watch me, Rin.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.680
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to you.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.360
What are you doing?

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.600
What are you doing?!

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.240
Please don’t!

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.680
Please don’t hurt me.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.040
(Thrill Sound)

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.920
What are you doing?!

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.880
Call for a backup.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.800
We’ll seal off the wood and search for the cellar that Wit told us about.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.800
That’d be where Narong took Songyod and kept him captive.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.680
Inspector, this is the place where Rin killed herself.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.480
It’s nearby those areas where we found the victims’ bodies.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.360
It’s possible that Narong might go back to the place where his sister killed herself.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.680
Inspector!

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.520
Someone annonymous called us and said that she has some clues about Narong’s whereabout.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.240
I think she’s probably someone was raped by Songyod.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.960
I’ve looked into all evidence.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.520
Everything confirms that it’s the same place.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.040
I’m sure Songyod is locked up there.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.040
Are you sure?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.720
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to the wood and find out where the cellar is.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.680
Thongthai and Khem, come with me.
We must find the location of Songyod’s safe house.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.400
We’re running out of time.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.000
We must find Narong and stop him.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.480
But Songyod is...

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.560
We’re not going to stand by and watch anyone commit a crime...

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.000
eventhough the victim has done something unforgiving.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.760
(Wailing)

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.680
Our job is to devlier them into the hands of the laws.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.600
Got it?

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.680
Yes, sir!

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.880
Let’s go!

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.080
(Laughing)

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.240
(Thrill Sound)

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.480
Hey!

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.400
Ouch!

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.080
(Airplane sound)

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.240
The noise there was very loud.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.640
I don’t know what it was but it was so irritating.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.160
There’s a loud noise.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.440
This is the place.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.200
We’ll divide into 2 teams.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.920
Yai.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.480
(Wailing)

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.400
(Thrill Sound)

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.400
Hello, everyone.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.880
What you are about to see...

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.920
requires parental guidance.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.400
Those who wish to walk down this path,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.560
this will be your punishment.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.160
The adults should be more aware...

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.400
and pay attention to normal people who have no power.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.440
People who have been bullied...

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.480
and the innocent ones who have fallen victims...

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.080
to an evil and disgusting act like what this rascal did.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.200
What he deserves the most...

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.680
is the punsihment from hell that you are about to witness.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.480
(Screaming)

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.720
I promise you...

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.040
that I will not let you die so easily.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.000
(Screaming)

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
(Thrill Sound)

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.000
(Screaming)

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.720
Please...please don’t hurt me.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.680
Look.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.240
(Whip lashing)

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.400
(Whip lashing)

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440
- (Whip lashing) / - (Wailing)

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.240
(Whip lashing)

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.760
- (Whip lashing) / - (Wailing)

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.160
(Screaming)

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.320
(Incoming call)

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.120
(Incoming call)

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.960
Stop what you’re doing right now.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.600
Do you think you can bring justice to your sister by doing this?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.840
It’s the justice that I can choose for myself.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.280
And it’s about to be over.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.160
Stop it right now.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.640
Your sister probably didn’t want to see her big brother
become a criminal like the man who had hurt her.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.280
I’m willing to sacrifice myself for those who once fell victims follow suit.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.240
See you in the LIVE, Inspector.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.480
H...help!

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.080
Wait! Hey!

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.800
Damn it!

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.280
(Crying in pain)

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.480
Fuck!

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.720
Inform Phaya and his team that the cellar is in that area.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.640
They must hurry up and find the cellar. We’re running out of time.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.680
- Go. / - Yes, sir.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.680
Ouch!

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.760
(Wailing)

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.160
What’s wrong?

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.240
He’s going to kill Songyod.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.600
(Wailing)

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.880
Don’t worry.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.720
I won’t let you die that easily.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.360
Do you think you’re the only one who can escape the hands of laws?

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.880
I can do that too.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.480
And this is…

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.160
Geez, why is it stuck now?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.720
(Screaming)

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760
Arghhhh!

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.760
Stop!

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.680
It’s over.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.800
You can’t bring her back from death by doing this.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.760
If you kill him, he won’t get to be punished any further.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.800
But then no more people will have to fall victims to someone like him.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.320
Rin should be happy to see him die slowly and painfully.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.080
But you and your people are ruining my plan.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.280
I know you’re disappointed that a scroundel like him hasn’t
served the punishment for what he did.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.480
But that doesn’t mean you should become like him.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.120
Let the laws handle these people.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.400
The laws?

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.440
They are only for those who don’t have much enough power or money.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.880
You know that too.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.520
How many cases were sealed off and ended up in silence.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.720
Like my sister’s.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.680
And look what happened to these scumbags?
They can still start a new and live a happy life.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.360
What about my sister?

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.880
She was having a bright future ahead.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.840
She was getting married with the man she loved.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.000
But then she was forced to take her own life...

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.160
because of what a scumbag like him did to her.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.440
If you want him to serve his punishment...

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.240
you should keep him alive.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.080
If you kill him, he’d no longer be a criminal but a victim.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.720
And you would become the criminal instead.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720
I don’t care.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.720
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to my sister.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.680
(Gunshot)

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.160
(Gunshot)

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.880
(Gunshot)

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.640
(Gunshot)

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.320
(Gunshot)

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:52.960
(Gunshot)

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.760
Shit!

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.080
(Fighting)

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.880
(Fighting)

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.200
(Fighting)

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.680
Phaya!

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.600
(Fighthing)

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.040
Tharn!

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040
Tharn!

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.320
Tharn!

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.440
Tharn!

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.680
Tharn!

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.560
Are you all right?

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.040
I’m glad you’re safe.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.880
Tharn! Phaya!

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
This way!

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.000
Please be careful. Don’t let your wound come in contact with water.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.560
Thank you.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080
Tharn.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.960
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.680
I’m okay.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.480
Thanks to the bulletproof vest,

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.040
or else my wound would be much deeprer.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.240
Why didn’t you treat your wound?

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.520
It’s all right. I’m good.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.120
Tharn.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.920
Can I ask you something?

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.880
Tharn.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.120
What happened to Narong…

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.480
in the cellar...

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.240
Those green eyes.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.640
They are exactly what I saw in my dream.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.280
I also saw those eyes when you were drowned.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.240
How did you save me back then?

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.200
I can’t remember either.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.160
I just knew that thing would save our lives.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.200
Then everything just happened like a miracle.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.200
Do you think that something which tried to attack me twenty years ago...

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.720
is now coming back?

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.440
That something...

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.600
might never stay from you at all.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.680
This is like what happened at the camp.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.360
And the training centre.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.640
- Pull him up! / - Phaya!

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.200
You’re always there to rescue me.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.120
What’s this all about?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.320
I don’t know too.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.480
Hey...

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.160
I’m...I’m sorry.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.480
You got hurt because of me.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.680
It was just a coincidence.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.640
It wasn’t your fault.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.000
I was just doing my job.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.160
Tharn.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.800
When you got hurt,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.440
I was really afraid you’d die. I don’t want to feel like that anymore.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.800
I promise...

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.040
that from now on I’ll always listen to everything you say.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.880
Please don’t leave me.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.240
I’m not going to leave you.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.600
We’re on the same team.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.920
How can I leave you?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:49.680
What about...you thinking that I told Chalothorn about your dream?

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.160
Are you still mad at me?

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.600
Tharn.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.840
I don’t care about anyone.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.120
I already told you.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.440
I’ll listen everything you say.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.200
I’m so sorry.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.280
For being an asshole.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.200
It’s okay. I’m glad you’re safe.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.720
You said you couldn’t remember everything that happened in the cellar.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.840
You said you put your fingers on the kettle...

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.600
in order to destroy your fingerprints.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.240
That’s why we couldn’t find any fingerprints at the crime scene.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.360
(Pouring out water)

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.720
(Boiling water)

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.240
You don’t have to ask me anything.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.040
If you want to arrest me, just put me in jail.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.840
You want to bring justice to your sister,

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.640
but you also killed those three victims.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.920
The one who killed them...

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.240
is you.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.920
And those bastards...

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.520
who use their power to bully someone defendless like us.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.080
The laws that you cherish and look up to...

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.120
can never keep those scumbags behind bars for long.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.200
They will get out and roam around happily.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.160
But victims like me...

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.160
who have to carry those scars they had left on us,

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.440
can never live the life we used to have again.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.240
Are you calling this justice?

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.360
Is it really fair?

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.000
You are not different from those scumbags.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.520
Yes.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.160
But I still believe.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.600
I still believe that justice also takes time to proof itself.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.480
But my sister’s time is done.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080
Let me ask you one thing.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.400
Do you really think the job you’re doing...

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.960
is something that a hero would do?

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.520
You might not see yourself like that.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.040
But when in trouble,

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.600
to those people out there, you’re a hero.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.840
You’re their hope.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.280
But then...

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.000
why a hero like you couldn’t do the right thing.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.520
And help those who are in need.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.440
Why?

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.320
Inspector.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.400
We’ve arrested Songyod.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.960
Khem and Thongthai have found another evidence...

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.040
which are video clips of him raping other victims. They were hidden in his house.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.360
Mr. Songyod.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.360
(Shoutings)

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.760
Please calm down.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.720
That’s the justice you’re looking for.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.400
It might show up late.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.400
But it will always come in the end.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.880
I’m not going to let the victims or those who get hurt...

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.400
falling into despair and giving up on justice like what you did.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.080
I give you my word.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.560
Inspector.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.680
While we were searching Narong’s house,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.080
we found a video clip of his sister before she committed suicide.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.000
Thank you, my brother.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.960
Thank you for always taking care of me.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.240
I’m so lucky to be your sister.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.800
When our parents left us,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.320
I always thought my life would never be happy again.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.120
But it’s not like that at all.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.160
Although you’re the only family I have left,

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.760
I still feel so happy like when our parents were with us.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.200
I want to live my life.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.680
I want to enjoy it.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.920
I want to stay happy like that forever.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.320
But right now...

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.960
my happiness is gone.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.040
(Crying)

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.800
All because of that bastard.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.760
He took my whole life from me.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.240
He took my happiness away.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.640
He took my body and my soul.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.080
These days…

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.200
I’m dying inside.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.800
You told me to wait.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.240
You told me to be patient.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.240
But I’m too tired.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.680
I want the laws to sentence him to death.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.520
But the laws has given me death instead.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.280
Me, who is the victim.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.840
I’m sorry.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.280
I’m sorry.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.200
I’m so sorry.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.720
Narong had tried to file a case against Songyod for many times.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.480
But it never went far.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.280
And the case eventually got dismissed…

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.800
because there wasn’t enough evidence.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.280
A few days after Rin was released from the hospital,

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.680
she took her own life.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.120
When Narong said that police like us are also responsible for his sister’s death,

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.960
I guess it’s true.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.720
I don’t want someone who gives up so easily on my team.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.920
Right now, we might not be able to bring justice to everyone.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.960
But that doesn’t mean we won’t be able to make it happen.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.640
If you are feeling discouraged just by hearing what they said,

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.400
I recommend you to quit.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.600
I don’t want a loser on my team.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.280
Even if I couldn’t help every victim,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.240
I’m not going to run away.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.560
I’m not going to leave those who are in need of help...

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.480
ever falling into despair like her.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.880
Me too.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:16.240
I decided to become a cop because I still believe that justice still exists.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.320
Those who have done wrong will eventually pay for what they did.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.920
I don’t want to.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.960
I don’t know how to do it.

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.840
Singh.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.520
Come here. I have something to tell you.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.360
So,

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.080
What do you want to tell me?

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.600
Can you do me a favour?

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400
What is it?

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.640
Your job is to gather information...

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.520
which also includes information about the cold cases, right?

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.920
Well, yeah, if it’s about the case then maybe I can help you.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.920
Why are you asking though?

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.720
I want you to dig up an old case.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.920
I want to know the names...

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.200
of police officers who took care of that case.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.000
Which case?

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.400
About my father.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.760
I’m going to bring justice to my father.

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.280
Don’t worry, Grandma. I’m still all intact.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.640
I’ll call you later. See you in a few days.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.920
Yes.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.200
I tried to ask Narong about what happened in the cellar today.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.200
But it seems he wasn’t aware of what was happening.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.280
As if everything got blacked out.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:03.560
Singh said that the lie detector indicated that Narong was telling the truth.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.240
Is there anyone who can explain what it is that we saw?

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.800
Damn it! Ouch!

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.440
Hey.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.760
Let me see.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.200
It’s just a graze.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.080
Wait here. I’ll fix the wound for you.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:39.480
(Funny Sound)

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.880
why didn’t you say anything now that I come crashing your place again.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.680
If I were you, I wouldn’t have wanted my grandma to see myself in this state.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.360
Forget it.

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.680
Are you done?

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.680
Yeah.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.320
Thanks.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.160
Wait.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.560
(Heartbeat)

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.560
(Romantic Sound)

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.560
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.960
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.320
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.480
(Romantic Sound)

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.560
Let me check on your wound.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.240
Don’t worry.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.560
The doctor already took care of it.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.280
I want to do what you just did to me.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.520
(Romantic Sound)

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.920
- What were you thinking?
- What’s wrong?

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.600
Umm, well...

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:52.720
When I was a kid, my grandma always blew over the wound after fixing it.

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.200
Can you...can you do it too?

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:05.920
What if my saliva happen to be in contact with your wound? It might get infected.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.960
Didn’t they teach you this in school?

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.320
Geez!

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.760
Then let me check on your wound.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.920
No need.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.080
The doctor already took care of it.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.480
I’m going to rest now.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.520
I’m not feeling well.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.040
The medicine is starting to kick in.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.120
Okay.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.360
Sleep well.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.440
Okay.

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.760
Go rest. I’ll keep watch for you tonight.

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.160
(Doorbell ringing)

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.840
Huh? Who’s visiting this late?

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.040
It’s probably Yai.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.680
I asked him to fetch me some of my clothes from my place.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.400
I probably have to crash your place quite often.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.600
Okay.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.800
(Door opening)

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.880
I didn’t know you’d be here.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.720
I have to finish off some work with him.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.200
What are you doing here?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.840
I’m here to visit Tharn as usual, just like what I always do.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.000
We have to talk.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.440
I don’t care how close you are to Tharn.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.920
But I think you should know your place.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.640
It’d be best for you to play the role of his big brother. Not something else.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.400
Right now, Tharn and I...

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.720
and everyone in our team...

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.400
have a lot of things that we should keep...

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.680
confidential.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.360
I don’t want him to see you so often like before.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.040
- Why? / - You want to know why?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:53.680
Because Tharn might accidentally slipped out something confidential about the investigation to you, like what he did last time.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.960
- So? / - So...

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.560
it might badly affect the unity in our team.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.840
Your reason seems nothing personal at all.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.440
I’ll try my best to heed your advice.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Until your time is done.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.000
Okay?

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.080
Phaya.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.640
I will never let you take him away from me.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.440
This necklace is probably yours.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.280
Keep it. It will protect you.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.960
Where did you get this amulet?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.400
Exactly the same.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.600
(Romantic Sound)

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:36.560
(Romantic Sound)

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Mum.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.240
Mum.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.160
If you don’t let go when I count to three,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.440
I’m going to sleep here.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.200
1 2 3.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.120
I already counted.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.200
Well then...

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.480
I’m going to be your bolster for tonight.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.840
What the...?!

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.359
Ouch!

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.479
Who are you?

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.359
How did you get in here?

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.399
It’s me, Phaya.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.040
I’m Phaya.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.760
My wound.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.399
Ouch...

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.640
Ouch...

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.399
How did you get in here?

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.920
I shouldn’t have trusted you.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.840
You had a fever last night.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.840
I used a damp washcloth to cool it down.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:18.600
When I was about to leave, you just held on to me so tight.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.560
You should have thanked me.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.279
For letting you hugging me all night.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.920
Me? Hugging you?

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.880
Yeah.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.080
You were hugging me so tight last night.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.240
(Phone buzzing)

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.279
(Phone buzzing)

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.600
Good morning, Luangpor.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.319
I’ve been quite busy with my first case so I didn’t have time to call you.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.600
Oh, you had it rough since the first one?

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.320
Yes.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.160
It’s the victim turned attacker.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.720
When your mind is shrouded by hatre or anger,

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.440
you will become obsessed with that thing.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.800
Remeber...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.400
Mindfulness can help strengthen your mind.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.840
Being mindful at all time...

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.840
will help strengthen your meditation and leads you to the enlightenment...

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.880
which would then help you to distinguish between the good and the evil.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:32.160
But some people will always choose to do something evil.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.560
Like those scumbags who never hesitate to take advantages on other people...

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.360
and push them into the darkness filled with despair, humiliation, and vengeance.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.000
Those victims are left with no choice but to fight back in order to survive.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.800
They have to kill.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.840
The basic code of moral conducts for human beings like us...

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.960
is the 5 precepts.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.560
One should be abstained from killing other living beings.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.760
These precepts can bring peace and happiness to your family and the society.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:13.200
Undertaking the five precepts will benefit not only yourself but also the people around you.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:20.200
I used to believe that a person would be good or bad depends on what they did in their past lives.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.120
But that’s not entirely true. Karma isn’t the only thing that shapes us.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:33.080
Dhamma also helps refine and enlighten our mind to be able to tell the right from wrong.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.920
It cannot cancel your karma.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.360
Just because you did something good,

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.440
whether building a pavillion, a chapel, or even a temple, in hope that it would help erase your wrongdoings in the past.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.840
That’s impossible. You cannot undone what you already did.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.000
What you did will eventually comes back to you.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.160
That’s right.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.320
Karma is the sum of our own actions.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.720
This morning, Tharn did something bad to me.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.800
He hurt me.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.440
So, he’ll pay for what he did soon.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.120
Do you want another one?

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.440
(Incoming message)

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.200
[Nee: Grandma is sick. Come home ASAP.]

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.680
Shit!

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:27.960
Hey,

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.520
Yeah?

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.520
I’m leaving.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.800
Goodbye, Luangpor.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.160
What’s wrong with him?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:49.440
Tharn, do you still receive a treatment from that doctor?

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.120
Not anymore.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.960
But he still checks on me regularly.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.160
But I don’t know why Phaya seems to hate him.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.920
Those two should avoid each other if possible.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.240
As if Phaya would listen to me.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.640
He follows me everywhere like a dog’s flea.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.600
Nee, where’s Grandma?

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.000
She’s upstairs.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.160
Grandma!

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.320
Are you sick? Why didn’t go to the hospital?

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240
Who’s sick?

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.400
I thought you said you’d come back in 2-3 days.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.120
Nee texted me and said that you’re sick.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.280
Come here.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.280
- What is it?
- Just come.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:38.000
Grandma could hardly eat or sleep. She’s always grumpy too.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.560
So, I thought she might be a little sick.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.840
Because she misses you.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.600
You tricked me again.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.640
I’m serious.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.560
Since the day you left for a training at the camp,

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.640
she really thought you might stay home more often after the training was done.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.960
Turns out you hardly came home.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.200
So, she’s upset.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.440
Go on your knees and beg for her forgiveness.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.400
Hey, wait.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.800
Well, Grandma...

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.960
I finished my work earlier than expected so I came straight home see you.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.440
I thought you were not feeling well. I was really worried.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.360
Don’t try to sweet talk me.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.680
Grandma...

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.000
Please don’t be mad at me.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.720
I’m really sorry.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.400
Please forgive me, okay?

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600
You’re really something.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.280
Ouch.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.640
What’s wrong?

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.480
What happened to your hand?

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.400
It’s nothing, Grandma.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.040
Take off your shirt right now. I want to see why you are hurt when I touch you there.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.240
Take it off.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.440
Careful. Slowly.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.120
Let me see.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.880
Oh my goodness.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.280
I never knew your job is this dangerous.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.880
Oh dear. Nee!

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Come and look at your brother.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.960
- I’m coming.
- Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.680
He told me to keep quiet because he was afraid that you might be worried.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.120
It’s just a graze, Grandma.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.240
It’s really nothing. I’m feeling great.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.160
Please don’t worry too much. I’m really fine.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.520
Phaya!

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.840
Don’t say that.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.880
If you think I overreacted...

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.880
and don’t want me to mess with your life,

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.200
then I’ll leave you alone.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.400
Grandma.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.360
Please wait, Grandma!

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.520
Geez.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.720
You’re such a lousy guy.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.680
Now, she’s even more upset. Why did you say that?

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.880
I’m so doomed.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.560
What to do now?

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.760
Stay home tonight, have dinner with her and talk to her.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.440
Wait for the right timing and try to beg for her forgiveness again.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.840
But right now, you better go take a shower first.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.640
You stink. I can hardly smell my dessert.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.400
Now, you’re overreacting.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:16.920
Geez.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.520
Grandma.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:24.240
(Lovely Sound)

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.240
We finally meet once again.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.280
Who are you?

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.640
Why are you in my dream?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.160
Don’t you remember me?

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.360
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.880
And you’ll finally see.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.280
idol Factory

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.760
Nee.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.800
Is Wi still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.480
She already quit to open an art gallery.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.800
Phaya!

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
Try looking in that room.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:06.440
It might have something that you want to know.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:39.480
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:46.920
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:55.320
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:05.760
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:13.160
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.680
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.760
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:28.000
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:32.440
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:40.000
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
