- Tharn.
- The Abbot asked me to warn you...

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.560
- to try to stay away from water.
- Tharn.

Master Garuda.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.880
No!!!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.040
It really is Kao’s body.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.120
He was killed and dumped here.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.760
The knot on his ankles looks exactly like the one on Lieut Tam’s.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.280
(Gunshot)

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.400
Phaya!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.840
Help!

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.160
Please stop.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.200
If you kill Phaya, your human form will also disappear.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
I don’t care. I will never let them be together.

Phaya!

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.080
Phaya! Please stay with me!

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.160
Phaya! Stay with me!

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.880
Prepare to inject 1 amp of Adrenaline.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.680
Okay.

Emergency Room

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.560
I can’t love anyone.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.360
If I love someone, I will end up losing that person.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.200
And I don’t want to lose you.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.840
I want to have you by my side but this is all I can do.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always stay by your side.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.800
I will do everything to make sure you won’t regret it or lose me. I promise.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.040
Yes, sir.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.800
Yes.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.000
I won’t make the same mistake twice, sir.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.360
Yes.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.160
Yes, sir.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.160
Goodbye.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.839
(Slap Sound)

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.720
(Gunshot)

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.920
You won’t get away next time.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.680
I’m sorry, sir.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.440
I thought you said you could handle it.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.000
Are you sure no one saw you?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.880
Yes, sir.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.480
Piphop, you son of a bitch.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.160
I killed you long ago.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.840
But you still send your son to come after me.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.640
Yes, sir.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.520
I already have evidence of the location where Montree produces drugs.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.120
I’m going to take my wife and kid back to Nong Khai first.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280
Then I’ll come back to hand over the evidence to you.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.240
Yes, sir.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.240
Got it, sir.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.960
Thank you, sir.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.600
I’m done, Dad.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.880
Let’s go then.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.080
Dad, tell me honestly...

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.000
why do Mum and I have to stay at Grandma’s place?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.480
Tharn.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.280
I promise I’ll often come visit you.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.600
I’m not going to leave you and your mother there forever, okay?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.680
Don’t worry about me. All you care about is work anyway.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.720
That’s not true, Tharn.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.760
Then why do you take me to stay with Grandma?

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.200
Why can’t I stay home in Bangkok?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.160
Well, I...

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.760
Tharn, listen to me. He will also be left alone there without anyone to take care of him.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.360
Please try to understand him.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.200
He does everything to protect us.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.360
He does it because he loves us.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.360
If he really does, then he should have stayed with us.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.320
Tharn, I love you so much.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.159
But right now, you and your mother won’t be safe if you stay close to me.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.560
Let’s go.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:57.320
(Exciting Sound)

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.080
Come help us quickly.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.520
Can anyone please call the police?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.640
Both of you are so nosy. Like father, like son indeed.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.840
I’ll do you a favour and send your son to live with you.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.240
Do you want me to take care of it now?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.280
Not yet.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.520
Go and take care of Kao’s case first.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.880
And also keep an eye on Ning.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.440
Find out if she knows about Kao’s fraud.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.440
Yes, sir.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.160
Tharn.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.640
How is Phaya?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.440
I don’t know. He’s still in there.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.880
Has anyone told his grandma and sister?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.760
I already did. They are probably on their way here.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.760
So, what happened?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.560
Why was he drowned?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.600
I don’t know either.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.400
How did Phaya drown?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.520
How is he, Doctor?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.960
The patient is experiencing a lack of oxygen in his brain.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.680
He’s been transferred to the ICU...

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.120
and is now getting oxygen via a respirator.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.120
I’ve also prescribed a vasopressor to increase his blood pressure.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.000
I’m afraid you won’t be able to see him tonight.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.560
Is he going to be okay?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.000
I will do my best.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.440
These belong to the patient’s.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.400
Tharn! Tharn! Tharn!

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.880
Where are you?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.720
Tharn! Tharn!

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.840
(Crying)

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.880
(Doorbell Buzzing)

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.240
Doc.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.040
I heard about Phaya.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.760
Don’t overthink about it, okay?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.400
It’s all because of me.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.840
(Emotional Music)

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.320
If I had let him go...

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.080
he wouldn’t have ended up being like this.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.640
Tharn.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.000
I don’t want you to blame yourself.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.760
It has nothing to do with you at all.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.520
But you already know...

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.160
that if I love anyone,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.440
that person will be taken away from me just like before.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.760
Tharn.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.840
It might not be the same with Phaya.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.400
I want you to believe in this love.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.560
He probably doesn’t want to see you cry too.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.080
Let’s not overthink about it.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.640
I’ll stay with you tonight.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.240
Don’t you worry about anything.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.400
Tharn.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.600
If you’re worried about Phaya, you can go visit him.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.360
We’ll give you a recap of the meeting later.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.400
- Um / - Um

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.120
It’s okay.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.720
He’s already moved out of the ICU.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.520
His grandma and sister are looking after him.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.520
They’ll call if they need anything.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.720
I want to get this case done as soon as possible.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.480
Everything is going to be all right. I’m sure he’ll get well soon.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.480
And will be back there at his seat.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.320
(Scaring off)

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.920
You scared me.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.800
The picture on the left is the knot on Kao’s ankles.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.720
The one on the right is the knot on Lieut Tam’s ankles.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.560
They are the same.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.760
And the forensic team has also confirmed that...

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.080
both victims have the same cause of death.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.320
They were dead before being dumped into the water.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.120
Have you gone back to examine the crime scene once again?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.080
We’ve examined the area which is around 900m away from the crime scene.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.920
We have found traces of car tyres tracks.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.720
After analyzing the tracks and the data from the CCTV cameras…

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.480
around the shop in the area,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.200
we have identified a suspected car coming out of the area around the crime scene.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.840
What about the plate number?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.280
It’s a fake one.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.560
On the day that we found Kao’s body,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.440
I encountered the suspect who was ambushing on us.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.600
While I was about to arrest him,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.320
he resisted and tried to fight back.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.000
It was then that I got a glimpse of the tattoo on his arm.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.360
It’s the same tattoo I saw on the person who killed my parents.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.920
Hold on.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.720
Are you saying that Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.640
Yes.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.840
And the person behind these cases...

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.040
is Montree.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.040
Do you have any evidence to confirm that Montree is the culprit?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.120
Those victims are also somewhat conneted to Montree.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.000
I think we should issue a warrant and summon him for interrogation.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.160
I only believe in evidence.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.240
If you want me to believe in what you said,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.000
go and find me the evidence.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.600
I’m going to warn you for the last time.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.720
If you can’t separate work from personal matters,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.400
I’ll have you removed from this case.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.400
You have to calm down, Tharn.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.400
Don’t argue with Inspector Akk or try to challenge him.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.760
I don’t know if you’d listen to me.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.040
But please calm down and think twice about that gunman.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.000
Otherwise, Inspector will give you an earful about it again.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.040
You still don’t have a solid evidence too.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280
So, stop overthinking about it.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.240
But I’m sure it’s the same person.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.560
And I will find the evidence to confirm it.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.280
Where are you going?

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.800
To see someone who can help me find the evidence about my father’s case.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.320
I’ve gathered all the information about your father’s case.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.600
They’re all in here...

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.200
including the list of your father’s colleagues too.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.040
Don’t tell anyone especially the Inspector that I did this for you.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.440
I know that.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.480
I promise not to get you into trouble.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.840
Inspector will never know about this.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.720
Hold on.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.480
What is it?

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.200
I don’t know if I should tell you this.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.600
I think this case is...

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.880
probably connected to a much bigger one.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.680
The Inspector’s older brother…

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.280
was your father’s right-hand man, the one who took care of Montree’s case.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.360
Are you serious?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.360
Is this Inspector’s brother?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.000
Why doesn’t Inspector tell you that he knew your father?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.040
Lieut Itt killed himself...

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.960
because he was caught for taking bribe.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.320
And the one who looked after this case...

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.720
was your father.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.440
Are you sure you’re not going to come and live with me?

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.000
Thank you so much, Uncle.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.840
But I really don’t want to bother you.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.440
It’s not a bother at all.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.720
Both you and Itt are like my own sons.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.800
You’re like a family to me.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.280
Itt also asked me to take care of you.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.920
You have done much enough for me, Uncle

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.760
And don’t worry about your education.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.760
I’ll take care of that.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.480
I already told you that you’re like a son to me.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.400
Okay?

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.680
Is it Korn who did this?

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.200
Yes.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.120
Do you want me to arrest him?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.080
Not yet.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.040
I don’t want to ruin our big case.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.880
Keep investigating on the drugs case.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.920
And try to be especially careful during this time.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.600
One of our teams is investigating about Korn.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.160
Yes, Inspector.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.320
Doctor, how’s my brother doing?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.800
He’s stable right now.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.040
Please excuse me.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.680
Phaya.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.320
Nee.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.720
I’m starting to agree with you.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.280
That he shouldn’t have become a cop.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.200
Only bad things happened to him.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.400
You have to stay strong, Nee.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.600
So that at least Grandma can lean on you.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.640
I’m scared for Grandma too.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.680
When I see him like this,

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.400
I don’t know if I’d be able to stay strong for her.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.560
Then let’s do this.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.040
When you’re with Grandma, you have to try to be strong.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.440
But when you’re with me,
you can be yourself and cry as much as you want to.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.040
I’ll be a shoulder for you to lean on.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.440
I’m sorry…

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.760
for not taking a good care of him.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.400
So, he has to be like this.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.400
I thought you gave us your words that you’d take a good care of him.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.600
Why did you let this happen?

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.760
We never wanted it to happen either.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.280
We are worried about Phaya too.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.040
Let’s go outside, Nee.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.800
Hey, are you faking sleep to prank us?

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.160
Get up, man.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.960
Yeah. Get up and help us with the case rigth now.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.880
Don’t just lie there like a log.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.400
I...

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.360
I’m sorry.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.000
I’m sorry.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.960
It’s all my fault.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.920
You’re like this because of me.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.080
I shouldn’t have left you alone.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.360
Tharn, it’s not your fault.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.400
It was an accident.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.960
More importantly,

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.640
he’s still alive.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.120
And I really believe that...

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.800
he’s also trying to find his way back to you.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.400
Hasn’t he already promised you?

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.600
That he will always stay by your side.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.960
A man like him will always be true to his words.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.920
He won’t give up so easily.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.080
He will be okay, trust me.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.720
If he knows that you’re crying like this because of him,

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.600
I’m sure he wouldn’t like it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.600
He wouldn’t want to see the person he loves crying...

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.480
and blaming yourself like this.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.160
Tharn.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.920
Tharn.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.440
Listen to me.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.320
Listen to your brother.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.320
If you love him,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.440
you have to believe in him.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.120
And you must not give up.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.520
We write our life with our own hands.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.880
You too, Phaya.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.840
I already gave Tharn to you.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.800
And you already promised to take care of him.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.680
I’m not taking him back.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.840
If you don’t wake up soon, I’m going to find him a new boyfriend.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.920
And make sure he’s better looking then you.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.360
Phaya.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.160
Hello? Do you have any lead?

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.480
Okay, thanks a lot.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.000
I know a friend who is an ex-cop.
He has asked around about the gunman.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.320
He said some of the gunmen...

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.960
use tattoos to identify which gang they belong to.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.080
Which gang uses a spider tattoo?

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.800
I sent him the spider tattoo that you sketched,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.680
he said this gunman is probably one of the ex-soldiers gang.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.800
But he couldn’t find out who exactly it is.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.520
How are we going to investigate further then?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.360
My friend said you should go to this place in Ekkamai.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.400
And ask for a manager there named ‘Mon’.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.280
He used to be a gunman.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.680
We might get some useful information from him.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.440
Let’s report Inspector about this.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.160
He might agree with us to go talk to the manager.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.640
No need.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.840
Why not?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.520
I’ll do it on my own.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.040
Are you crazy?

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.720
Inspector will eat you alive if he finds out.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.560
Leave it to me. I’m going to do it alone.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.760
I don’t want to get you guys in trouble.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.240
Tharn, I can’t let you do something risky like this.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.840
But if you report this to the Inspector,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.320
he might have me removed from the case.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.680
He would think that I’m mixing my personal matter with work.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.160
What if something bad happen to you?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.880
The Abbot and your grandma would definitely kill me.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.520
I promise I’ll be very careful.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.560
Then, we’ll go.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.400
You stay here and look after Phaya.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.120
If my babe is going, then I’m going too

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.520
Then I’ll go too.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.960
I don’t want to get hit on the head with the Abbot’s alms bowl.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.800
So will I.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.320
What do you wanna do?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.320
It’s a family matter.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.840
I don’t want you guys to be in trouble because of me.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.840
Just let me handle it.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.560
But you’re like a brother to me, Tharn.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.520
Your parents are like mine too.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.320
You stay here and take care of Phaya.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.520
So that you’ll be the first one he sees when he wakes up.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.200
I agree with you.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.000
I agree

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.800
Tharn.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.280
Hey. I’ll let you choose whether you’ll let us go with you...

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.280
or I’ll call the Inspector.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.080
You no longer have the Naga Amulet to protect you, Phaya.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.600
- Mr. Mon, the VIP guest has arrived.
- Um

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.320
Okay. Both of you, take care of everything down here.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.600
I’ll go upstairs to take care of the guest.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.480
Hey, that’s Mon, the manager of this place.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.080
But the owner of this place is Pong.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.840
My friend said the gunmen will come here to get their orders.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.640
They are guarding the place right now.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.800
Hey. He's here.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.760
Cheers!

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.600
Shit!

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.920
So sorry.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.680
- Give it to me.
- Really sorry.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.600
Go take care of the guest for me first.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.320
I’ll go down to clean up a bit.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.040
I’m sorry. Really sorry.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.360
Tharn. Khem.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.720
(Vomiting)

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.400
Look at your brother.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.360
Let’s go.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.160
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bump into you.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.320
That’s all right.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.200
Hey.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.640
Who are you? What do you want?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.440
Let me go!

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.440
Stay still.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.400
Ouch!

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.520
Tell me, who has this spider tattoo?

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.720
I don’t know.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.440
But your face says otherwise. You know.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.080
I don’t want to trouble you.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.080
Just tell me his name.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.400
Give us his name.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.760
Or we’ll dig up more and put you behind bars.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.640
I really don’t know whose tattoo it is.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.800
Don’t try to play innocent with us.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.840
Tell me, or I’ll find a way to shut down this place.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.680
Fine, I’ll tell you.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.960
Let me ask my men first.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.800
Hey, what are you doing?

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.000
I’m taking out my phone.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320
Ouch!

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.199
Tharn!

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.719
Dammit!

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.760
What happened?

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.639
Go get all of our men!

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.080
Get them!

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.200
Tharn, follow him! Quick!

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.440
Tell me! Who has this tattoo?

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.760
I don’t know!

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.880
You don’t?

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.080
Run!

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.680
Chart!

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.760
Tharn! Tharn! Are you okay?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.760
The man with the spider tattoo is Chart.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.800
Chart?

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.760
Follow him!

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.600
Phaya.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.360
Finally, we meet face to face, Garuda.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.600
Chalothorn, why are you here?

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.600
Do you really believe Tharn will love you if you kill me?

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.640
But it wouldn't be hard for Tharn to love me without you.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.480
(Fighting)

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.320
You can't make Tharn love you no matter how many lives you live.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320
(Fighting)

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.840
I will imprison you here.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.160
When Tharn and I fall in love, you'll see.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.840
(Fighting)

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.800
Please stop.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.840
This is the last warning from me.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.840
Don’t commit any more sin.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.400
The one who should stop is you.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.640
Mind your own business.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.760
(Roaring)

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.760
(Body tremor)

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.600
Phaya!

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.720
Phaya!

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.280
What’s wrong?

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.200
(Seizure)

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.640
(Pushing)
Ouch!

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.520
What are you doing?

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.320
Phaya

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.320
What happened?

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640
Stop it!

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.920
(Pushing)
Back off!

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.760
I have to put this necklace on him.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.720
(Crying)
Phaya!

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040
Phaya!

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.720
Hey!

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.920
Phaya!

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.480
- Phaya! / - Doc

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.280
Phaya!

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.400
Phaya! Do you hear me? What’s wrong?

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.080
(Crying)
Phaya!

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680
Phaya!

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.720
(Crying)

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.040
Prepare for CPR.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.560
Phaya!

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:46.240
(Crying)

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920
His pulse is back.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.120
(Crying)

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.920
(Crying)
Phaya.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.480
(Crying)

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.160
(Crying)

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.560
(Crying)
Phaya.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.480
(Crying)

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.600
Tharn

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.880
Ouch!!

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.040
(Smashing the table)
Dammit!

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.520
Do you realise that your reckless actions will get us all into trouble?!

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.040
I’m sorry, sir.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.240
Sorry? Isn’t it too easy?

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.680
Our team will be investigated by the disciplinary committee.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.480
There will also be punishments.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.840
All because of your...

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.040
All because of your brainless acts.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.520
What happened last night...

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.320
is all my fault. They have nothing to do with it.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.640
I will take responsibility alone.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.440
Inspector.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.480
Please.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.400
I want them to stay on the case and keep investigating.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.240
If you guys really want to help me,

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.800
then find out who the real culprit is.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.240
I will take all the punishments alone.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:25.080
(Fighting)

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.800
Tharn.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:56.920
Ouch.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.680
Ouch.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.480
The spider tattoo.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.920
Why does he also have the spider tattoo?

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.120
Phaya?

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.960
You’re still recovering. Why did you leave the hospital?

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.640
Tharn.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.080
What’s wrong?

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.920
I’m sorry I couldn’t recognise you.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.360
If I had recognised you a little earlier,

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.480
I wouldn’t have let you stay close to that man.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.880
What do you mean?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.800
From now on, always stay close to me.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.920
You have to stay by my side.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.960
Because you are only mine.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.880
idolfactory

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.360
Tharn and I, we are dating each other.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.320
I want you to come stay with me here...

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.720
until the Day of Judgement has passed.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.800
We have to gather as much information as we can.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.640
Do you know my father, Inspector?

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.920
He already knew.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.320
Why does he have to hide it from us?

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.240
Tharn, Ning agrees to be our witness.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.240
(Strangling / Gasping for air)

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.600
Did you just see a vision?

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.560
Korn is going to kill Ning.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.760
Chai must be killed by the tiger-man.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.800
Tiger-man is not real.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.320
How do you know?

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:17.480
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:25.000
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.440
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:43.480
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:51.160
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.520
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.760
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:06.240
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.440
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:17.760
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
