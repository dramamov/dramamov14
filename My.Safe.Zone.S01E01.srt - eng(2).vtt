00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:04.145
Tan, are you okay?

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:09.225
I put the things you asked me
to buy right next to your bag.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.745
Thanks a lot. Are you really okay?

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:16.265
It's just a little headache.

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:18.185
It might be a migraine.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:22.025
Have you taken any medicine?

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.625
I'm okay. Don't worry.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:30.545
I think you should go rest.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.945
We'll finish late today. Still a lot
of shots left. Tomorrow's a big day too.

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:36.345
I can handle things here.

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:40.345
Go on.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.065
Go now.

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.185
I'll just leave my stuff here then.

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:51.745
Okay.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:17.345
Finished earlier than expected.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.185
BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.545
I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU, ALIN.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.865
I LIKE YOUR WORK.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:47.025
YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.945
It would be nice if we could
live together like this forever.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.465
I don't think

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.465
I could love anyone more than I love you.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.065
Would you mind…

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.425
if I asked you to be with me forever?

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:00.705
To love only me?

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:06.545
Will you marry me?

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:10.065
Yes.

00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:05.225
Get out.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.585
-Lin!
-Lin!

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:19.305
I said get out.

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:33.145
How many times have you slept together?

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.505
Huh?

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:36.865
How many times?

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:39.585
Lin, I'm sorry.

00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:44.105
Why agree to marry me if you like men?

00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:46.265
Huh?

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:47.625
-Why did you lie to me, Kate?
-Lin…

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:49.305
-Why did you deceive me, Kate?
-Lin.

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:51.625
Lin, please listen to me.

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:52.985
I'm sorry.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.145
I'm really sorry. I truly am.

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:00.025
Get out. Get out of my life.

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:01.425
Kate.

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:02.665
Lin.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.265
Please listen to me.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.785
Please…

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:25.345
‎Lin.

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:26.785
Get out.

00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:30.505
-Lin.
-I said get out. Get out.

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.425
Kate, that's enough.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.545
Jane,

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:51.145
bring the green curry
to Aunt Aom for me, okay?

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.025
Okay.

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:55.225
It's on the table.

00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:50.825
Aunt Aom?

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:55.145
Aunt Aom?

00:08:58.945 --> 00:08:59.785
Aunt Aom?

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:03.385
Eh?

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:05.345
Aunt Aom?

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:08.825
Aunt Aom?

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:05.345
Jane, I have something to tell you.

00:10:05.425 --> 00:10:06.665
What is it?

00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:09.265
-This.
-What is it?

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:11.545
She wrote a song for me.

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:13.105
Let me see.

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:17.865
Ugh, it's so lame.

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:19.665
She doesn't deserve you, Lin.

00:10:20.345 --> 00:10:21.505
This song is ancient.

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:25.305
Oh, come on, Jane.
You totally ruined my vibe.

00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:27.745
Meh.

00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:29.185
I think it's cute.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.865
This spot…

00:11:20.905 --> 00:11:22.105
is saved for you.

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.665
I'll bring it to your house
once I finish writing.

00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:33.385
Okay.

00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:55.505
Jane, hurry up.

00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:58.345
You've been upstairs forever.
Haven't you changed yet?

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:03.265
Aunt Aom, where's Lin?

00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:05.945
I brought back the shirt
she asked me to write on.

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:08.385
I'll go up.

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:10.425
Jane.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:17.865
I just took Lin to the airport.

00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:19.985
Where is she going?

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:23.665
Um…

00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:25.385
She's going to study abroad.

00:12:29.345 --> 00:12:32.465
She probably won't be back for years.

00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:35.905
She didn't tell you?

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:07.865
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:13:07.945 --> 00:13:10.225
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:27.265
Jane.

00:13:30.585 --> 00:13:32.545
Aren't you happy to see me back?

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:34.465
Why should I be?

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:38.705
Move. I'm walking.

00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:43.465
But I missed you.

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:45.665
Missed me?

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:51.265
If you missed me, why didn't you
reach out? Why didn't you call? Text?

00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:54.825
If you're going to lie,
make it believable.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.945
Are you really going to treat me
like I'm a stranger?

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:10.345
Yes.

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:13.985
But we're friends.

00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:17.345
We used to be. Not anymore.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:29.465
Jane, please listen to me.

00:14:29.545 --> 00:14:31.065
It's been eight years, Lin.

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:34.305
Eight years since you left my life.

00:14:35.665 --> 00:14:38.025
You think just coming back
makes everything the same?

00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:41.745
We're not friends anymore.

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:45.505
Get out of my house.

00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:43.585
By now, they're probably chatting away.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:47.625
I just want them to make up.
So, how long is Lin staying?

00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:49.665
Probably not long.

00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:52.985
She's always so busy.

00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:56.345
I don't know how she found time
to come home this time.

00:15:56.425 --> 00:15:58.625
And what about her girlfriend?

00:15:59.505 --> 00:16:00.625
The one she was going to marry?

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:02.585
You mean Kate?

00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:03.585
I'd love to meet her.

00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:06.945
I want you to meet her.

00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:09.305
Kate's amazing.

00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:12.465
Lin's really lucky.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:15.545
She has a stable career abroad,

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.145
and her girlfriend

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:21.465
is the daughter of a major
fashion manufacturer in New York.

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:25.505
I can die in peace now, honestly.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.985
I heard you're in Thailand.

00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:44.505
Wanna meet tonight?

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.705
How's your mom?

00:16:54.345 --> 00:16:57.545
She works every day. She's at the office
more than her employees are.

00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:00.025
The owner is working so hard.

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.265
That's why "W"
is one of the top fashion magazines.

00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.745
So, are you here on business?

00:17:07.704 --> 00:17:08.825
I'm on vacation.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:11.265
Thank you.

00:17:13.424 --> 00:17:14.665
You miss home, don't you?

00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:17.025
Yeah…

00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:20.025
Actually, I'm thinking

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.545
of moving back for work too.

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:27.464
Are you serious?

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.585
I'm serious.

00:17:37.745 --> 00:17:40.945
My mom's here. She won't move to New York.

00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:43.425
So I want to be here for her.

00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:46.865
But if a good opportunity comes up,

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:48.985
I might go back.

00:18:01.465 --> 00:18:04.625
Why are you walking around? Come here.

00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:10.745
Did you talk to Lin at all today?

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:12.265
No.

00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:15.065
You haven't seen each other in so long,
and you didn't even catch up?

00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:23.065
I didn't want to know anyway.

00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:26.625
I've been wanting to try
this chef's table place

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.625
but I can never get a reservation.

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:30.385
It's that hard to book?

00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:34.185
Yeah. It's fully booked until next year.

00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:37.865
There are only two or three tables,
and it's always packed.

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:39.985
They won't even add more tables.

00:18:40.585 --> 00:18:43.145
Look. It's called Jane's Table.
People tag it nonstop.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.665
It looks simple but kind of appetizing.

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:51.745
Right?

00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:55.265
I just wanna see
if it's really worth the hype.

00:18:56.265 --> 00:18:57.145
I see.

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.585
This is the owner.

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:15.705
If I can get a reservation,
will you go with me?

00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:18.225
Of course.

00:19:39.585 --> 00:19:41.905
Where is she? Why isn't she back yet?

00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:49.225
Not that I care.

00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:10.105
Jane!

00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:12.905
Are you hurt? Did I bump into you?

00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:21.225
Can you get up?

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:01.345
Come home late and drive carelessly.

00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:02.905
Jane, can I just say I'm sorry?

00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:04.385
Jane.

00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:08.905
Go back to your life in New York.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:12.785
Your job, your fiancée,

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.065
your whole life is there.

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:17.745
I'm just part of your past.

00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:42.905
You didn't read the documents I gave you,

00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:45.105
Lin?

00:23:10.545 --> 00:23:12.905
There's nothing left for me in New York.

00:23:35.825 --> 00:23:36.945
Yes, Lin?

00:23:37.025 --> 00:23:38.385
Hello, Aunt Tuk.

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:42.945
I was calling to see if I could
reserve a table at Jane's restaurant.

00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:47.025
Oh my, I'm afraid
I can't help with that, dear.

00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:48.905
You'll have to talk to Jane yourself.

00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:51.025
I'll pass the phone to her.

00:23:51.105 --> 00:23:52.985
Auntie. Aunt Tuk, wait.

00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:02.305
There are hundreds of restaurants,
why does it have to be this one?

00:24:07.185 --> 00:24:08.185
‎You've got a call.

00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:09.305
ALIN

00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:12.545
Lin wants to talk to you.

00:24:13.865 --> 00:24:15.185
I'm busy.

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:18.025
Jane, Lin can hear you.

00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:21.545
Good.
Then she'll know I don't want to talk.

00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:23.345
Jane.

00:24:26.185 --> 00:24:27.945
Don't call me.

00:24:28.025 --> 00:24:30.705
The tables are full. If she wants to eat,
she can book it herself.

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:32.665
It's available online. No need to call.

00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:36.945
HANG UP

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.105
Oops.

00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:44.225
Lin…

00:24:44.305 --> 00:24:45.785
I heard everything, Aunt Tuk.

00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:48.265
Thank you.

00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:56.105
You!

00:24:56.185 --> 00:24:58.625
When she left, you were heartbroken.

00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:01.505
Now she's back,
and you won't even talk to her nicely.

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:10.145
Your friend doesn't come back often.
Won't you talk to her?

00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:11.625
Better off without a friend like that.

00:25:12.225 --> 00:25:13.105
Why?

00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:16.665
Why are you so mad at me?

00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:28.145
Please go, Auntie. I'm not bumping her
to the front of the line anyway.

00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:35.985
It's good she left.

00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:38.065
And stop trying to fix things between us.

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:39.945
It'll never be the same.

00:25:41.225 --> 00:25:42.345
What do you mean?

00:25:44.065 --> 00:25:45.265
Ouch!

00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:46.305
I'm sorry.

00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:51.865
I'm sorry.

00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:53.345
Are you okay?

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:54.905
I'm so sorry, Lin.

00:25:55.985 --> 00:25:57.185
I'm sorry.

00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:03.505
Let's go outside.

00:26:09.625 --> 00:26:10.945
Sit here.

00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:16.825
Are you hurt?

00:26:17.545 --> 00:26:18.585
Wait a sec.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.625
-Ah.
-I'm sorry.

00:26:32.705 --> 00:26:33.665
I'm sorry.

00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:52.185
Is that gentle enough?

00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:58.705
Does it still hurt?

00:27:04.345 --> 00:27:06.025
I'm not hurting anymore.

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:07.705
Are you done…

00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:09.785
being mad at me yet?

00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:54.145
Not yet.

00:28:07.545 --> 00:28:10.505
You shoved your face so close.
My ears are all red.

00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:21.985
Why are you following me?

00:28:25.585 --> 00:28:27.785
It's just one table.
If you don't have one,

00:28:27.865 --> 00:28:29.785
I can carry one over from my house.

00:28:31.025 --> 00:28:33.625
What, you really want
to eat here that badly?

00:28:34.425 --> 00:28:36.945
Someone really wants to eat here
but couldn't book it.

00:28:37.025 --> 00:28:38.865
And she's very important to me.

00:28:40.665 --> 00:28:42.225
Is it Kate?

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:53.825
No.

00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:58.025
Don't be shy about it. You posted
about the engagement all over Facebook.

00:28:58.665 --> 00:29:01.625
Even if you didn't invite me,
it's not like I wouldn't find out.

00:29:02.585 --> 00:29:05.785
If Kate wants to come,
I'll reserve a special table just for her,

00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:08.305
as a wedding gift.

00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:18.185
Lin.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.145
-Lin.
-I don't want the reservation anymore.

00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:24.505
Let go!

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:30.745
Jane, are you hurt? I'm sorry.

00:29:34.705 --> 00:29:36.065
What's wrong?

00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:42.745
Did you have a problem with Kate?

00:29:56.865 --> 00:29:58.425
I broke up with Kate.

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:08.105
So you came back
because you broke up with Kate?

00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:14.225
There won't be a wedding anymore.

00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:23.465
Are you smiling?

00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:25.745
No.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.265
Are you feeling smug?

00:30:28.345 --> 00:30:31.905
Don't be silly.
No one feels happy about a breakup.

00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:14.545
Did you tell your mom yet?

00:32:15.545 --> 00:32:16.425
No.

00:32:16.505 --> 00:32:17.785
You're the first one I told.

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:21.705
When are you going to tell her?

00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:28.185
I don't want to.

00:32:46.625 --> 00:32:47.745
Are you feeling better?

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:55.425
If so, then go home.

00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:00.785
Can I stay a little longer?

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:05.265
I don't want to be alone in my room.

00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:12.025
I always wondered

00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:15.105
how someone who hates the cold like you,
could survive in New York.

00:33:15.185 --> 00:33:16.425
You'd freeze to death.

00:33:16.505 --> 00:33:19.665
I almost did.
Good thing I bought a heater in time.

00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:22.465
Are you faking being sad?

00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:27.705
Can I make a reservation?

00:33:30.145 --> 00:33:31.185
No.

00:33:32.505 --> 00:33:34.305
Just two seats.

00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:40.865
No girlfriend, so who are you eating with?

00:33:43.745 --> 00:33:44.665
A model.

00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:49.665
You just broke up
and already have someone new?

00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:51.745
No.

00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:53.505
Then who is she?

00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:55.145
Just a friend.

00:33:55.225 --> 00:33:59.945
She said she really wanted to try
your food, so I said I'd get her a table.

00:34:00.025 --> 00:34:01.225
I'm close with the owner.

00:34:01.945 --> 00:34:02.865
Used to be.

00:34:05.905 --> 00:34:06.905
Now go home.

00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:20.585
It's just one table, Jane.
Why are you being so possessive?

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:24.304
It's my restaurant. If I want
to be possessive, that's my business.

00:34:45.185 --> 00:34:46.585
Do good to get good back, huh?

00:34:56.465 --> 00:34:58.505
You left your hair wet too long.
You'll catch a cold.

00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:31.745
Wait.

00:35:33.345 --> 00:35:34.905
Me drying your hair just now

00:35:34.985 --> 00:35:37.105
didn't make you
even a little less mad at me?

00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:39.545
Thanks for drying my hair.

00:35:46.265 --> 00:35:47.225
That's it?

00:35:47.305 --> 00:35:50.345
Mhm. Yeah. Thanks.

00:35:50.425 --> 00:35:51.745
And the table?

00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:55.385
You just did it for the payoff.

00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:48.825
Once she's off work, I'll get her drunk.
Maybe she'll give me a table more easily.

00:36:51.865 --> 00:36:52.905
All set.

00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:56.785
Jane, the customer at table one
wants to speak with you.

00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:04.185
How good is the food here?

00:37:05.465 --> 00:37:06.865
There are so many customers.

00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:09.905
Your food is really delicious.

00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.985
I wasn't planning to wait,

00:37:13.065 --> 00:37:17.025
but now that I did , it's totally
worth it, even after all these months.

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:19.865
It's just simple home-cooked food.

00:37:19.945 --> 00:37:23.105
Then the food at your home
must be amazing.

00:37:36.865 --> 00:37:38.425
Closed already?

00:37:42.185 --> 00:37:44.305
Are you not even
gonna care about me at all?

00:38:00.305 --> 00:38:02.185
Why are you drinking?

00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:08.185
How did I end up like this, Jane?

00:38:10.065 --> 00:38:11.385
Like what?

00:38:13.785 --> 00:38:15.265
I studied hard,

00:38:15.985 --> 00:38:17.225
top of the class,

00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:19.585
got a scholarship,

00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:22.065
graduated with honors…

00:38:23.425 --> 00:38:26.025
Why is my life falling apart like this?

00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:31.305
You're drunk.

00:38:31.385 --> 00:38:32.945
Go home.

00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:33.945
I'm not going.

00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:35.985
So what?

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:38.825
You're just gonna sit here
and drink alone?

00:38:46.145 --> 00:38:47.625
Then sit and drink with me.

00:39:11.545 --> 00:39:13.185
Alright, that's the last one.

00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:25.825
These chairs are so comfy.

00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:38.625
I'm gonna take a photo.

00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:40.145
Why?

00:39:40.225 --> 00:39:41.825
To show her

00:39:43.505 --> 00:39:44.945
that without her,

00:39:46.185 --> 00:39:47.745
I can still be happy.

00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:50.545
Alright. I'll take it for you.

00:39:57.665 --> 00:39:59.065
Take one with me.

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.865
Why did you break up with her?

00:40:23.985 --> 00:40:25.105
Lin…

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.865
Do you miss her?

00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:34.825
Why would I miss her, Jane?

00:40:35.745 --> 00:40:38.025
Then why are you crying?

00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:41.985
Why the hell would I miss her?

00:40:43.105 --> 00:40:45.585
Why would I?

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:53.945
I saw her with a guy in bed.

00:40:58.105 --> 00:40:59.665
You don't believe me?

00:40:59.745 --> 00:41:00.905
Huh?

00:41:02.065 --> 00:41:03.665
You don't believe me?

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:06.585
It's not that I don't believe you.

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:08.545
Like this.

00:41:09.185 --> 00:41:10.505
Look, Jane.

00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:15.705
I saw them like this.

00:41:18.905 --> 00:41:21.025
Kate doesn't like women.

00:41:21.105 --> 00:41:22.905
She likes men.

00:41:37.105 --> 00:41:39.145
It hurts, Jane.

00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:42.705
It hurts so much, right here.

00:42:31.745 --> 00:42:32.945
Does it still hurt?

00:44:27.585 --> 00:44:29.985
This bakery went viral
for being super good.

00:44:30.065 --> 00:44:32.585
I was nearby, so I brought you some.

00:44:32.665 --> 00:44:34.025
Thank you.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:36.225
Is she a model or a thief?

00:44:36.305 --> 00:44:37.345
This is for you.

00:44:43.465 --> 00:44:44.465
What do I have to do

00:44:44.545 --> 00:44:45.865
for you to forgive me?

00:45:24.745 --> 00:45:25.905
