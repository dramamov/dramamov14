00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.680
- (Previously on "Player")
- All your ex-flings.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.240
That's enough. Time for a finale move.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.200
If you want to know about Phe, get in.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.720
Thanks for saving me again.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.120
It’s destiny!

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Just a friend, huh?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.840
You’re not flirting again, are you?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.760
If I find out you’re lying,
I’m telling Prang.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.960
I found a nice restaurant online.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.520
I’d love to take you there.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.520
I never knew you had a brother.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.320
Yes, an older one.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.840
He runs a restaurant in New York.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.400
Mind if I ask instead?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.280
Do you like women?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.760
If you really want to know,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.760
we’ll have to see each other more often.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.440
Oh, come on!
Just drop your card already.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.680
Uno!

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.440
Damn.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.400
Last card!

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.560
Yay!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.240
Serves you right.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.800
- Finally, I can go to bed.
- Wait, don’t get up yet.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.560
Krit, stop.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.240
I haven’t won.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.520
One more game, please.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.759
“My friends always say I’m too competitive.”

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.240
“No matter how small the game is.”

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.160
“Poj is really leaving.”

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.000
“Chai Klang.”

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.600
“Chai Noi.”

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.280
She’s so incredible.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.400
“Where is everyone?”

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.720
“It’s nothing.”

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.840
“It’s just that…”

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Our girl’s going to be famous for sure.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.840
“I just don’t want to feel like I’m always coming in last.”

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.200
Where do you live?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.480
I’ll take you home.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.200
“So, no matter what life throws at me…”

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.160
“At the very least,
I won’t let myself stay at rock bottom.”

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.320
“Even if I fall, I’ll climb back up.”

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.920
“I just don’t want to feel like…”

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.520
“I’m stuck waiting for someone
to pull me out.”

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600
“It’s not that I love winning that much.”

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.440
“But why…”

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.160
“Why do I have to lose?”

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.120
That’s so cute.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.600
Then…

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.480
I’ll put this one right in the center
of my collage.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.400
“Would you be free for dinner again, P’Ploy?”

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.960
“Why isn’t she replying again?”

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.480
“Am I getting karma
for ghosting all my old flings?”

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.880
Off shooting on location again, huh?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.960
Didn’t even tell me about this.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.920
Just don’t cause
any more trouble for now, okay?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.600
Phe?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.480
And if it’s not important,
please don’t contact me again.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.520
If there’s anything,
I’ll call you myself.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.960
It's Phe. I knew it.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.040
“Why did I never think of that before?”

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.520
“Of course… They're siblings.”

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.240
I think…

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.280
Ploy probably knows more
about Phetai than we thought.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.640
Yeah, maybe.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.680
Based on what we’ve got so far

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.240
it’s fair to assume

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.920
they could be related.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.880
But that doesn’t necessarily mean
they’re working together.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.880
Still, it’s suspicious, isn’t it?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.040
Calm down, girl.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.240
Ploy’s a luxury celeb,
a total rich girl.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.120
Why would she scam you for money?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.000
Or maybe she’s rich

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.800
Because she teamed up
with her brother to con people.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.240
Oh my god,
you’re just being dramatic.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.240
She earns tens of thousands
every time she shows up at an event.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.200
Celebs getting involved in shady businesses
isn’t that rare, though.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.159
True…

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.520
but do you really think

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.680
someone like Ploy Pitcha

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.480
would be a scammer?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.159
It’s hard to believe.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.440
Still, she must’ve known something.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.920
At the very least,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.200
she might have given Phetai a place to stay.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.840
Otherwise,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.560
Ploy might already know about him

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.880
that you were one of his victims,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.920
and that you’re out looking for him.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.560
Or maybe…

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.520
she already knows.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.560
That you’ve been digging
into Phe through her.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.240
But if she knew,
wouldn’t she have pulled away from me by now?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.000
Yet here we are...

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.280
getting closer and closer.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.720
Hmm?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.880
Aww.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.280
If you really want to know,
there’s a way.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.560
Just ask her straight up.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.800
No, just play it cool.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.120
Huh?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.160
If you ask her directly
and she is involved,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.760
you really think she’ll tell you?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.159
Worst case, Phe might catch on too.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.960
I say keep pretending.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.520
It’s the best move you’ve got.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.960
And what if Ploy figures you out?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.640
“See you soon.”

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.400
I’ve come this far.
There’s no turning back now.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.400
Whatever happens… I’ll deal with it.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.320
What’s up?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.960
I just stepped out for a little walk.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.600
Still got time before the event starts.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.200
Sneaking off for crispy pork?

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.120
What? No way! Who’d sneak out for crispy pork?
Not me!

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.760
You’re overthinking it.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.240
Okay, okay.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.520
I’m heading back up now.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.160
Talk later, okay?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.120
It’s not crispy pork,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.080
It's braised pork belly.
Big difference.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.040
(”Grand Terra Hotel”)

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.640
Besides the room we looked at earlier,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000
There's also a large hall
on the fifth floor for big events.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.920
But usually, if you have

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.440
fewer than 100 tables,
we’d recommend that one instead.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.880
Okay, then we’ll go with the smaller room.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.040
Perfect. In that case,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.360
we’ll send you a link
to fill out the booking details.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.080
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.520
Um, excuse me.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.800
Oh my gosh, you’re Jay!
Jay-Prang, right?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.680
You’re even prettier in person!

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.480
Aw, thank you so much.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.240
Do you also host weddings here?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.880
Oh, yes we do.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.400
You can take a look
at the details here first.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.720
Oh, is this the same hall
that’s hosting the event today?

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.480
Yes, that’s right.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.800
It’s gorgeous.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.560
It really is.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.200
You actually have to book it
at least two years in advance.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.880
Two years?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.920
That’s right. Two whole years.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.440
Are you interested?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.800
I’d like to book it right now.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.400
Oh, wonderful! Absolutely.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.360
Then I’ll note down the details here.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.080
Sure.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.680
- Okay.
- Jay Jirapat, please.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.960
Got it.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.360
Are you sure
you left your bag over there?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.920
Um… I think so.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.360
Stop! Wait!

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.160
The key!

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.560
What key?

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.320
Play it for me.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.200
Yeah, that’s definitely him.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.160
That’s Phe’s favorite shirt, for sure.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.400
Can’t see the face clearly though.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.080
Can you zoom in a bit more?

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.640
Closer, please.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.040
That’s as close as it gets.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.760
“Confirmed… that’s definitely Phe.”

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.120
“But what were they talking about?”

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.320
“And that key Ploy gave him…”

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.000
What key?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.240
“Anyway, if I can’t get any info today…”

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.400
“I’ll at least just win her over.”

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.760
“As in… charm her!”

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.440
“Until she spills everything.”

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.320
“With good music, a nice vibe.
Just the two of us.”

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080
“As if.”

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.920
“Why would Ploy invite these two along?”

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.840
You look stunning today.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.880
Obviously.
I look stunning every day.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.480
Ugh, you two make me sick.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.600
Gross.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.120
Enough, stop teasing the kids.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.720
A jealous little girl.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.160
Ew, ew, ew!

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.480
Such bad manners.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.120
- Should’ve let her sit alone
- Right.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.680
Whoa.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.960
[People whispering]

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.800
She really steals
the spotlight every time.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.320
So Ploy Dior has become
her new stage name.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600
Ploy Dior.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.480
Ploy Dior.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.320
Ploy.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.160
“Of course. She wants me to get jealous.”

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.560
“And probably boost her ratings
while she’s at it.”

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.000
Who did Ploy come with, Jay?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.560
Oh,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.200
Min.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.160
She’s from a high-society circle.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.240
But I’ve never actually talked to her.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.160
Is that Ploy’s new girlfriend, Prang?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.280
Stop gossiping.
they’re coming this way.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.400
Ploy! Min!

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.560
Please, have a seat.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.560
How have you been, Prang?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.200
It’s been ages
since we’ve all hung out like this.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.200
I really miss those old days.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.840
Well, it’s your fault, Min.
You never join us.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.880
I only came today
because I wanted to meet the real Jay.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280
Nice to meet you, Jay.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.160
You’re even prettier in person.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.720
After we finish eating,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.840
Can I get your autograph for my niece?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.240
She’s eight. A huge fan.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.840
Of course, Min.
We should take her out sometime too.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.480
Sounds great. Let’s make it happen.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.080
Pun,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.880
This is Min. She’s my friend.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.200
Nice to meet you.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.000
You must be Pun, right?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.920
It’s lovely to finally meet you.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.000
Ploy talks about you all the time.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.560
So, how’s business going, Min?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.280
It’s been doing quite well, actually.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.040
Except that…

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.840
Someone keeps coming by for free food.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.320
Hey! Don’t slander me like that.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.160
She shows up more often
than at her own house!

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.760
Can I come along next time?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.680
Sure, why not?

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.600
Let’s all go together.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.200
Excuse me, I’m gonna go to the restroom.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.520
Want me to come with you?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.520
It’s okay, I’ll be fine.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360
What day would work for you?

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680
How about next week?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.880
Does she really not know
this was supposed to be just the two of us?

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.480
Or is she bringing another girl
just to make me jealous?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.040
Are you talking about me?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.560
No.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.080
I wasn’t talking about you, Ploy.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.560
Are you mad at me, Pun?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.560
Well, did you do anything
worth getting mad about?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.440
Good question.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.440
What did I do, exactly?

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.440
Nothing.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.080
You didn’t do anything, Ploy.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.640
Okay then.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.200
Hey,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.840
What’s wrong, girl? What happened?

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.240
Guess it’s our turn now.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.520
“Luckily, I came prepared with backup.”

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.640
This actually works out perfectly.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.000
Wait, what do you mean?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.000
I already made a reservation, actually.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.720
But since Ploy said she booked too,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.320
that means we’ve got two extra seats.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.840
You want me to come for drinks?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.360
No, I want you to help me.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.040
What?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.160
Help you with what exactly?

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.560
Didn’t you say
you wanted to be alone with her?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.080
Yeah, well… I’m not sure yet.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.800
But better too many
than too few, right?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.760
Just in case something happens.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.760
But there are only two spots left.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.840
Meaning…

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.000
Pick me!

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.960
Over here!

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.560
No, no, no!

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.320
- Ugh…
- Here we go again.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.880
Mhm.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.600
Ones and twos!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.600
Ones and twos!

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.880
Ones and twos!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.560
Some people just have all the luck,
huh, Waanjieab?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.520
Sorry, Waanjieab.
Better luck next round! Cheers!

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.240
Pun’s still not back?

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.240
I thought I saw her walk this way earlier.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.640
Maybe she ran into someone she knows.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.560
Wait.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.359
I need backup.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.680
What? We’re just getting to the fun part!

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.480
You stay here,
My sister’s met you before.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600
And you…

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.760
Dressed all cool, total Korean style.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.080
You’d make the perfect date for me.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.680
Date!?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.840
Huh!?

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.800
Don’t tell me. A date? Who?

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.720
Don’t even say it.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.400
Pun, God’s gonna strike you down for that!

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.120
Come on!

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.400
Just thinking about it
gives me chills.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.520
Please help me out here.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.560
Are you sure, Pun?
You’ve got a whole group of friends here.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.360
Hm? It’s fine, Chakrit.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.680
Ahem. Everyone.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.960
This is Chakrit, my friend.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.960
He came alone,
so I invited him to sit with us.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.480
Hope that’s okay.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.000
Of course, have a seat.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.520
Nice to meet you all.
Thanks for having me.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.480
Ladies first.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.320
Ooh, such a gentleman!

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.480
Chakrit.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.520
Huh? I remember you’re...

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.280
“Crap, did Prang ever meet Krit before?”

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.320
A chef, right?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
That’s right, yes.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.960
Wow, Prang, good memory!

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.920
I remember because Pun mentioned you once.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.360
Yeah.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.080
I’ve been telling everyone
about Chakrit, actually.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.640
Funny, I don’t recall you telling me.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.880
Well, we only just got close,
didn’t we, Ploy?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.440
Give it time.
I’m sure I’ll tell you more soon.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.120
Excuse me, who's having the cocktail?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.120
Over here.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.280
This cocktail is yours.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.360
I didn’t even order yet.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.640
You ordered for me, Ploy?
You really know me well.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.840
Then next round,
you order one for me.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.120
French fries!

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.280
Wow.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.920
Oh, no, it’s fine… really.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.720
Ahh, Chakrit’s favorite. I remember.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.640
I've been cutting carbs lately,
but since you’re feeding me...

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.760
I’ll make an exception.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.600
Is it good?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.240
If it is, eat up.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.560
Ahh...

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.600
Guys who eat a lot are cute.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.080
You’ve got quite the appetite, huh?

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.240
Ahh...

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.640
There’s a DJ too.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.040
Looks like he’s opening the stage
before the band starts.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.920
Wanna go dance, Prang?

00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.960
Sure!

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520
Wanna dance with me?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.360
No, thanks.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.240
But I want to dance, Chakrit.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.480
Wow, didn’t even let me finish my fries.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.800
Go dance with me, then.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.960
Thanks for going along with me.
You’re the cutest.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.280
Aren’t you afraid someone
will snap a photo for Instagram?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.760
Nah. We’ve gone public.
I can do whatever I want now.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.200
Besides, the fans are loving it.
Think of it as good publicity.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.080
Took me a while to find you;
the helmsman of the Jay–Prang ship!

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.520
It's you all along.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.840
I’m not just the helmsman.
I’m the captain!

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.600
Put your arm around my waist.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.320
Do I have to hold you this close?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.280
Come on, don’t be so stiff.
It’s just a casual hold.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.680
Casual?
This doesn’t look casual at all.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.680
Are you trying to make Ploy jealous?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.360
You’re supposed to be getting info from Ploy,
not just making her jealous.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.240
This is part of the plan.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.280
I’m investigating… if she gets jealous.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.600
If she does, it means she likes me.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.600
And if she likes me,
that means I’ll get the info I need.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.000
Not sure about her,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.720
but what about you?
Feeling jealous yet?

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.000
Jealous? Of what?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.360
A tiger doesn’t fall for its prey,
you know.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.360
Honestly?
I think you’re starting to catch feelings.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.000
Krit!

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.800
Oh, Nont! What are you doing here?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.640
I’m just hanging out with some friends.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.280
“Damn, that’s Krit’s ex-fling.”

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.920
Yeah, it’s been a while.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.720
How’ve you been, Nont?

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.000
I’m good, just busy with work.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.200
You’ve changed your type, huh?

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.800
Hey, it’s not what it looks like!

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.760
Hey, it’s fine, really.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.520
The world’s open now.
Love is love, right?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.640
Let’s just say... I get you.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.800
Anyway, I’ll go find my friends.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.880
Nont, wait!

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.440
Damn it, Krit!

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.000
Ugh! This is all because of Krit!

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.560
You’ve ruined everything!

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.400
Aha.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.080
That restlessness of yours…

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.040
is it because you
didn’t get to investigate,

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.360
or because you’re jealous?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.000
I’m not jealous.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.080
Don’t deny it, Pun.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.080
When love

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.280
sneaks into your heart,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.560
there’s no stopping it.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.000
I’m not in love!

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.520
Not even interested!

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.320
Good for you, then.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.840
Wait, aren’t there supposed to be

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.760
an angel and a devil on your shoulders?

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.200
So who are you?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.760
Huh?

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.680
Well, since we’re chasing
after a million baht,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.000
it should be Angel...

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.200
and Sherlock Pun!
That’s more fitting.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.280
Ugh, my brain’s fried.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.920
Don’t lose focus, Pun.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.560
This time,
money’s on the line and so is our pride.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880
Heh heh heh...

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.320
Hello?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.440
“Hi, I’m calling from MPL.”

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.600
“We came across your freelance profile.
It’s really impressive.”

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.800
“Our company’s developing
a new mobile application.”

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.200
“So we're interested in having you
design the artwork for our new app.”

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.760
“Would you be available
at the moment?”

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.080
Yes, I’m available, sure.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.400
“Great. We’ll send you an email
to schedule a follow-up meeting.”

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.760
- “Thank you for your time”
- Okay, thank you so much.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.400
Yay!

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.880
Mind if I join you?

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.360
Go ahead, if you want.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.280
Why didn’t you tell me
you were back last night?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.840
I was tired.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.360
I just wanted to rest.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.040
So what brings you here, Ploy?

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.000
I came to see if a certain
someone’s sulking.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.280
I’m not a kid.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.960
Yes, you are.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.560
A kid with a wild imagination.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.240
Making up stories...

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.200
and sulking all by herself.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.400
When exactly did I ever sulk at you?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.120
“What should I do, Pun?”

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.440
“Oh god, what now?”

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.440
“Don’t fight it, Pun.”

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.600
You can’t resist love
once it starts flowing through your heart.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.880
Pun, you’re on an important mission right now.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.880
If you lose focus
and fall for your target,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.440
your million baht will vanish in a heartbeat.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.760
Just one kiss. That wouldn’t hurt, would it?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.840
Give yourself a little reward, Pun.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.800
Yeah.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.960
Just one kiss.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.560
It wouldn’t hurt, right?

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.520
Think of it as scoring a few points, Pun.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.720
“If you’re going to do it,”

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.280
“Then answer this honestly, Pun.”

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.120
Are you doing it to win her over,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.120
Or is it because of your own desire?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.360
“There’s only one truth.”

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.840
If you can’t answer that question...

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.640
then maybe you shouldn’t do it at all.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.840
Maybe, we should talk later.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320
I’ve got work to do.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.040
But I’m not sure I’ll still have time to talk.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.480
Some chances,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.480
once missed, are gone for good.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.280
I’ll get going then.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.160
Okay.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.200
Ouch...

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.360
What’s wrong with me?

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.320
Morning, babe.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.160
You’re up early.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.280
Don’t you have the day off today?

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.840
Mhm.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.720
Jay...

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.560
Yeah?

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.840
Do you remember what we talked about...

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.480
the day Pun first got back to Thailand?

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.720
About what?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.400
About Ploy.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.600
And Pun.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.040
Yeah.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.320
Don’t you think
things have been a little strange lately?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.360
Like... last night, for example.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.400
I don’t know.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.480
But if something is going on between them,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.560
I actually feel bad for Pun.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.320
You know what Ploy’s like.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.320
But honestly...

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.600
do you really think someone like Ploy

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.600
would chase after anyone that hard?

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.560
Not really. Why?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.440
Exactly. It just doesn’t add up.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.680
Don’t stress yourself, babe.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.440
You’re overthinking it.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.960
Worry when there’s actually
something to worry about.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.040
[Phone ringing]

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.640
Hello?

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.040
Um, Grand Terra Hotel?

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.480
About the reservation...

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.640
Sorry, what event did you say?
The signal’s...

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.520
Prang!

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.480
Okay, I’ll call back later.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.280
Thank you.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.560
Something wrong?

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.040
I booked a spa day at that hotel,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.560
but they just called to cancel said they’re fully booked.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.600
I really wanted to take you there, Prang.
It’s hard to get in.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.640
But just now, she mentioned
something about an event?

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.160
An event…

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.240
Maybe they’re hosting a big one.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.680
They’ve got a ton of clients,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.160
probably packed.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.440
I’ll book again soon and take you next time, I promise.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.520
Okay.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.080
Your skin’s been dry lately, babe.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.520
Let me grab you a face mask.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.600
What’s up with her?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.120
“Actually, about the wedding hall.”

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.800
“A client just cancelled their booking.”

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.920
“So we might have an opening
for late this year or early next year.”

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.520
“Would you like to confirm your reservation now?”

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.920
Guess I’ll have to
propose to you soon.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.560
Pun.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.440
Pun, hey.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.080
Sit down, please. Sit down.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.400
Mick?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.320
So...

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.240
The company that reached out to you
was mine.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.760
Your company?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.560
That’s right. I’m the CEO.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.520
Wow, it must be such a great company

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.440
to have the CEO himself, talking to an employee.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.960
I just wanted to have a little talk with you, Pun.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.640
If it’s not about work,
I’m not interested.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.920
Pun, please. Just hear me out.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.360
About our relationship,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.560
I want to make things right to change.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.880
I was impulsive back then.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.760
And I promise
I won’t show off anymore.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.760
That’s enough.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.960
When I said it’s over, I meant it.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.920
I miss you, Pun.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.240
“There it is.”

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.800
Making the most out of a bad situation.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.840
Use this CEO to our advantage.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.000
Wait,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.600
Don’t tell me you’re going
with the jealousy plan again.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.080
I’m telling you...

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.440
this plan doesn’t suit you, Angel.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.760
[Sighs]

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.960
Satisfied now?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.280
Still, I really don’t recommend it.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.280
I’m not into love or any of that.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.320
But logically,

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.400
this will only make things worse.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.920
But if she gets jealous,

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.360
it means she likes you.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.680
And more importantly,
you might even earn yourself a few love points, Pun.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.080
Think it through.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.120
Don’t overthink it.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.640
Well, Mick...

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.240
I’m glad to know you still think of me.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.720
“Will she get jealous?”

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.560
We meet again, Pun.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.520
This restaurant’s mine, actually.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.800
Enjoy your meal.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.080
I’ll leave you to it.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.160
Pun.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.400
That woman just now, she’s an actress, right?

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.400
Yes.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.760
We live in the same building.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.960
So what

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.960
just happened back there?

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.200
What do you mean?

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.040
It’s always like this.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.480
But before she came,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.400
You were turning me down
just a moment ago.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.720
And suddenly...

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.840
It’s nothing. Really.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.600
I’m not stupid, Pun.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.639
But I get it.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.120
Mick...

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.080
Look…

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.639
if you ever change your mind,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.639
just let me know.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.159
But..

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.880
don’t use me
to make someone jealous again.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.960
Got it?

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.040
Let’s just eat.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.639
Forget it.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.880
We’ll talk business after we finish.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.920
Seriously?

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.840
It’s nothing.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.199
Shh.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.360
So what now?

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.040
Well, at least

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.400
Mick’s mature enough.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.440
He’s still hiring me for the project.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.120
And you’re sure he won’t come after you again?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.600
He promised

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.120
he wouldn’t get involved
in my personal life anymore.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.000
Besides,

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.720
he’s the CEO.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.160
He won’t have time
to mess around with an employee.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.400
So,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.160
Is Ploy actually mad at you?

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.480
I’m not sure, honestly.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.320
But I think I’ll just hire
a private investigator instead.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.160
Once I start working and get paid,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.360
I’ll have some money to spare.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.000
Help me find one, okay?

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.040
You’re starting to feel guilty,
aren’t you?

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.240
Or maybe...

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.200
you’re feeling something else.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.440
("The Deviana")

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.000
Hold on, it’s still hot.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.680
Prang.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.760
Hm?

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.600
Why do you love Jay?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.840
Why ask?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.840
Just answer me.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400
Are you asking seriously right now?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.760
Yeah.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.840
Hmm...

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.160
I just do.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.640
Come on, give me a real answer.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.080
I’m serious.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.880
Sometimes love

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.000
doesn’t really need a reason, does it?

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200
Just knowing you love someone,
that’s enough.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.880
Then...

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.280
Aren’t you scared, though?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.160
Scared of what?

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.720
Getting hurt.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.760
Being disappointed.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.080
Sometimes, sure.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.920
But sometimes,
you just have to take the risk.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.320
And what guarantees

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.360
that you made the right choice?

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.880
A guarantee?

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.960
There isn’t one.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.200
Nothing in this world

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.800
ever stays the same anyway.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.040
Oh.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.080
Then why bother tying your feelings

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.200
to something so uncertain?

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.120
Look at it this way.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.720
Imagine

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.240
there’s a cookie in front of you.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.120
You can either eat it, or not.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.240
You never try my cookie,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.720
You never know if it’s any good.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.720
The only way to find out

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.160
is to take a bite.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.760
But if you hesitate too long,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.680
you don’t dare to try,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.960
you might never get the chance again.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.280
So? Is it good?

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.520
Mhm.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.840
But people aren’t cookies, Pun.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.000
The right one for you

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.440
might only come once in a lifetime.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.640
It’s good.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.360
Hello? I’m on my way now.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.080
Don’t worry, I’ll make it in time.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.200
Traffic’s crazy today.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.280
Oh, my makeup!

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.680
I dropped it in the car.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.760
Oh, it’s green! I’ll call back later!

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.520
Ploy!

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.080
Where are you heading?

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360
To work.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.520
Well…

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.640
What time will you be back?
Want to have dinner together?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.080
I have a job in Rayong.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.240
You never told me
you were going out of town.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.480
Did you even ask me first?

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.200
So...

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.160
When will you be back?
Do you want me to pick you up?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.440
I already have a driver.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.600
Excuse me.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.520
Uh... Ploy?

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.920
Ploy...

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.840
Are you mad at me?

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.400
What makes you think I would be?

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.920
Well, yesterday...

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.960
You saw me at the restaurant
and didn’t say a word.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.600
I saw you with your friend.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.880
And we’re talking right now,
aren’t we?

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.440
At this rate, if you don’t leave soon,

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.360
you’re going to be late for work.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.560
Hey, Ploy!

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.400
Don’t be like this. [sobs]

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.800
About yesterday,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.040
Mick, the guy I was with. He’s an ex.
But that was a long time ago.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.760
And now he just wants
to hire me for a job.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.360
I didn’t know! I swear! I’m so sorry.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.480
And Chakrit, he’s gay.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.000
He does drag
and looks prettier than me, honestly!

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.920
I was just teasing you.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.240
I didn’t mean anything. [sobs]

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.200
Ahem.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.160
Are you laughing at me?

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.880
I’m laughing
because you’re adorable.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.960
Give me your car keys. I’ll drive you.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.440
The keys...

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.800
Here.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.560
But if you drive me,

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.560
How will you get to your work?

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.600
Ji will come pick me up.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.520
Where’s the car parked?

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.480
Right over there.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.440
Let's go.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.520
Whoa!

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.920
Oh no! I got powder all over your shirt!

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.960
It’s fine.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.080
Really, it’s fine.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.200
I’ll have Ji bring me
a new shirt later, okay?

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.480
Okay.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.560
Let’s…

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.120
have dinner together sometime.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.800
Sure.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.440
Let’s get to work.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.640
"Just admit it already."

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.000
“You’ve got feelings for her.”

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.360
I won’t admit it.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.640
And I won’t lose either.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.640
Lose on what?

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.240
Losing to my curse

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.640
or losing to your own feelings for Ploy?

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.920
I meant

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200
the investigation.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.160
What?

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.880
You said you’d hire
a private investigator.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.400
I thought you were done
digging around for info from Ploy.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.520
Well…

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.320
Ugh.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.000
Look!

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.520
Whatever I say, you never listen.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.080
And I can’t stop you
from being so competitive either.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.240
So if you don’t want to lose,

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.320
think of it as a new game.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.920
What do you mean?

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.680
Instead of

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.800
focusing on who falls first,
or who wins,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.280
try changing your perspective.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.800
Refocus.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.680
If you make her fall for you instead,

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.720
you win.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.280
But now,

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.040
if you end up liking her first,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.000
it doesn’t really count as losing,
does it?

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.240
I’m giving you your next quest.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.880
“Get on it before it’s too late.”

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.480
Pun.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.080
Yes?

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.800
The client from Phuket
just called me about the file.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.320
Oh, I'm sending it right now.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.840
Kwang, check the contract details too, please.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.720
“People"

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.080
"aren’t cookies, Pun.”

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.040
The right one for you

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.240
might only come once in a lifetime.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.720
Ploy,

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.320
Are you done with work yet?

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.600
Pun.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.920
I already told you in chat
you didn’t have to come.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.800
You didn’t want me to.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.240
But you still texted me your room number.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.960
I didn’t say I didn’t want you to.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840
It’s just far and it’s late.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.400
What?

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.360
Aren’t you even happy to see me?

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.880
Did I ever say I wasn’t?

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.800
So tell me…

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.600
You kissed like a girl
on her first kiss.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.280
Why?

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.800
Because...

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.360
I was holding your hand like this?

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.280
I mean…

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.880
how you just bumped your lips into mine like that.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.440
Then let me try again.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.400
Still such a baby.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.880
Let me show you how adults do it.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.080
"So..."

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.480
"Does that mean I win?"

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.640
I think we should stop here.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.960
Ploy...

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.880
I’ve got an early shoot tomorrow.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040
I’m sorry.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.200
Okay then.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.560
Let’s just sleep
in each other’s arms tonight.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.280
Okay.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.720
Morning, Ploy.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.960
Morning.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.120
Your hair’s a total mess, huh?

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.560
Sleepy?

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:52.840
Mhm.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.360
I’ll sleep more.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.280
Mmm.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.080
I don’t want to go yet.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.040
I just want to stay
with you a little longer.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.880
I'll head out soon.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.120
Well,

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.240
If I didn’t have errands today,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.480
I could’ve stayed with you all day.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.360
Drive safe, okay?

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.320
I will.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.240
Let’s go.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080
Bye.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.320
See you soon.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.720
[Phone ringing]

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.760
Hello?

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.560
"Have you read the email I sent you?"

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.440
Oh, I just parked.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.440
I’ll check it now.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.320
"Go ahead and open it."

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.840
"I’m sure you’ll be pleased."

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.480
Who’s Phe talking to?

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.040
Golf?!

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.960
- (Next episode)
- Do you have any idea

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.000
where Phetai is now?

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.160
Where’s my half a million!?

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.720
I don’t want to investigate Ploy anymore.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.240
Think carefully, Pun.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.040
What’s the most important thing right now?

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.040
Pun, everyone just wants to help you.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.480
But we can’t unless you open up to us.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.000
I don’t like liars, you know.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.280
“Welcome to Heart Pop Sports Day!”

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.160
Having you here already feels lucky enough.
