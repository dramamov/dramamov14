00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.320
I’m the boy who almost got drowned, the one that Tharn had rescused on that day.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000
Attention!

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.800

They all have the same cause of death.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.560

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.680
The Sign

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.480
Are you saying that you killed Mr. Korn…

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.000
because someone ordered you to do it?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.560
Yes, I was forced.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520
Are you sure?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.520
Didn’t you kill him as a revenge?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.000
You sued him for the charge of sexual assault but unfortunately the case got dismissed.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.640
I didn’t have any choice. He captured me.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.640
And forced me to kill that man.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.560
I was so scared.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.840
I didn’t want to do it.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.520
But when I saw him dead...

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.880
I felt so glad.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.280
Now, he won’t be able to harm other people anymore.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.680
So, he was raped by his step-father?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.800
A victim is a victim regardless of the gender.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.320
The man who got killed is called Ong.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.760
He was charged with raping his step-son and just got out of jail.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.360
Then he committed the same crime again.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.720
You said someone abducted you and locked you up with your step-father.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.040
Can you recall what that man looks like?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.560
(Crying)

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.880
I can’t remember.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.560
Someone suddenly put a handkerchief over my nose.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.040
I didn’t even know when I passed out.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.040
Pat!

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.320
I had no idea how I got there.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.720
HURRY, PAT. PLEASE COME HELP ME!!

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.160
Can you tell us anything about the place you were locked up in?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.560
It was a square room.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.000
It was dark.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.160
And very dirty.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.040
There were lots of tools for torturing.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.200
Was the killer always there with you?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.240
No.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.240
When he appeared...

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.240
he would wear a clown mask...

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.720
and black outfit.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680
He would give orders and make me do as he said.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.400
If I refused...

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.560
he would torture me. I was so scared.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.840
So, I had to do as he said.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.640
The victim tried to hit on you.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.640
But you weren’t interested and turned him down. Am I right?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.520
He was a scumbag.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.320
He tried to rape me.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.960
When I told him I would go to the police,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.240
he would tell everyone that I tried to seduce him and that I wanted to sleep with him.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.400
So what? Those sexy dresses and shot skirts...however I dress up is my own business.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.760
He doesn’t have any right to mess with my body.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.880
Please calm down.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.159
Do you remember how the mask man wanted you to kill the victim?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.960
Cut off his tongue.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.760
(Screaming in pain)

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.800
Lashing.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.760
Cut off his genital.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.680
(Screaming in pain)

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.560
And shot him in the face.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.200
Where’s the genital that got cut off?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.080
The result from the forensic examination…

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.840
shows that the killer had thoroughly cleaned the body of all three victims before he hung them up.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.760
No fingerprints were found...

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.720
on the victims’ bodies and around the areas where the bodies were found.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.440
There wasn’t any witness or other solid evidence too.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.240
We already asked our three suspects to do the lie detector test.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.360
The results were negative.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.680
The only evidence found in the crime scene were the victims’ DNA.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.240
The killer is very careful.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.000
He didn’t leave any trace or evidence.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.480
The body of the first victim was found in the middle of the wood.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.200
The second one was found near the road sign.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.680
And the third one was found near the canal.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.040
The killer dumped these bodies around the area of the deserted wood...

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.600
which was once where the mental hospital situated.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.120
But judging from the bodies of the victims...

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.200
I don’t think there’s only one killer.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.120
The killer probably did this...

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.480
because he wanted to send us a sign or signal something.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.159
Our three suspects also said that…

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.320
the killer abducted them and forced them to kill the victims.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.520
He tortured them and turned their fear into revenge so that they’d kill.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.160
He’s definitely a psycho.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.720
But what they told us…

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.920
was quite hard to believe somehow.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.880
Who’d force someone to do something like that?

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.920
But this reminds me of another case in the past…

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.040
where a group of women came together to plot a murder on their exes who had dumped them.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.560
And made it looked like a robbery instead.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.720
I think there’s a similarity here.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.400
The three suspects might be in this together.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.840
But I don’t think they were lying.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.880
I’ve rechecked the interrogation tapes over and over again.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.360
They didn’t hesitate or beat around the bush when they answered the questions.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.400
It didn’t look like they had prepared the answers either.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.600
They were just telling us what had happened to them.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.840
I think they were telling the truth.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.720
I agreed with Thongthai.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.600
During the interrogation with Miss Pear.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.120
I looked her in the eyes but she didn’t budge or avert her eyes at all.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.400
If they were really forced to kill the victims,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.600
is it possible that the killer...

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.760
might use to experience this kind of violence or sexual assault before?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.400
That’s why he planned the murder...

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.800
to take his revenge on people like the victims.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.280
I’m going to divide you into two teams.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.320
Phaya, Tharn, and Yai.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.320
Find out whom the victims had met before they were captured.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.960
Singh, Thongthai, and Khem.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.480
Analyze the interrogation reports of our three suspects…

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.160
and find out the place where the killer locked up the vicitmes and killed them.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.960
Make sure you check every CCTV carmera around the suspected areas.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.560
Look for something that will lead us to the killer.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.360
No man can commit a crime and disappear without a trace.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.960
Hi, babe. I just got off work.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.880
Do you want to eat anything? I’ll buy it on the way home.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.640
What?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.160
Huh?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.520
What did you say?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.160
You want to eat me? You got it, babe.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.680
I’ll be right there.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.000
Please wait for me.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.360
- Let's go.
- Tharn, I can’t drop you off today.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.720
Go back with Phaya then.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.640
- Phaya, can you drop him off for me?
- What?

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.760
- Okay
- See you then.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.240
What the..? Yai!

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.840
Geez, Yai...

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.160
Let’s go. You’re coming with me today.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.160
Don’t bother. I’ll call a cab.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.360
My place and your place are on the opposite way.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.280
Wait, I said I’d drop you off.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.560
I’ll call a cab.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.800
I said I’ll drop you off.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.720
Tharn. Phaya.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.880
I’m going to gather as much information as I can tonight.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.680
So that we can find out something that will lead us to the killer.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.120
You two hurry up and go back home to get some sleep.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.040
We have a lot to do tomorrow.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.840
Our time is running out.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.600
But our time has just begun.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.960
What the...

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.240
Let’s go, babe. I’ll make a bowl of warm water for you to dip your feet in.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400
Behave yourself.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.880
Maybe I should also give you a massage. It’ll surely be a long day tomorrow.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.480
See you then.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.880
Baby.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.040
Let’s go. I’m hungry.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.360
But I’m not. I want to go home.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.920
But I am. Just come and eat with me first.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.120
Then I’ll drop you off.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.200
Let’s go.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.320
Here you go, it’s boiling hot!

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.680
Hey, watch out!

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.800
Go and take care of the customers over there.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.880
What do you want?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:20.280
Will you be able to finish them all?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.800
I haven’t eaten anything today.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.000
Neither have you.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.280
You were reading the case files all day long.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.200
Eat up.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.040
I want this case closed as soon as possible.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.200
I’ve revised the interrogation reports of our three suspects.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.320
I want to find out more about the noise that those three suspects heard.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.000
If we can identify that sound...

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.880
I’m sure we’d be able to find out the place where the murder took place.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.840
The noise there was so loud. So annoying.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.720
I could hear some noise. It was so irritating.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.200
There was a loud noise in the background. It got on my nerve.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.640
Stop thinking about the case and eat up.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.160
Where do you think the killer...

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.040
got rid of the genital that he cut off?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.520
Maybe in this pot?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.760
Here, just eat it, the genital that you are so fond of.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.600
Geez, I got food all over me.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.040
I thought you wanted it so badly.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.000
Oh, I’m sorry. Are you all right?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.880
Your life is short.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.200
You were supposed to be dead since when you were young.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.600
But your parents gave you to the Abbot...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.800
to extend your life and try to change your destiny.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.720
That’s why you’re still alive today.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.520
But young man, I warn you.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.280
You must look out for those whom you’ve wronged in the past life.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.000
They are very near.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.720
They are coming to take your life.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.240
Please excuse me.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.400
Don’t ever let go of that man.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.880
Don’t let those whom he’s wronged in his past life...

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.880
take him away from you.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.920
(Incoming call)

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.720
Hi, Nee.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.600
Phaya, where are you?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.960
I’ll call you back. I’m going home now.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.600
Be quick then. Grandma is worried about you.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.360
Okay.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.760
Who are you looking for?

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.880
That weird granny.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.920
I just turned the other way to pick up a call...

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.520
and she was gone.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.960
Let’s eat.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.200
But what she told me was exactly like what the Abbot said.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.160
Really?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.280
Yeah.

(Motorcycle sound)

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.640
Hey, are you okay?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.960
You don’t look so well since we left the restaurant.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.960
I’m okay.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760
Don’t worry.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.200
See you.

Why don’t you go home and sleep your bed? Wouldn’t it feel more comfy?

Why?

I got it fixed.

- The engine probably got overheated. It already cooled down overnight.
- I see.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880
Yai.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.240
Hey.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.280
You came by motorbike?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.120
Yeah.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.320
Don’t you have to return the helmet?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.720
No need.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.720
- Hello. / - Hey.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.720
Are you here together?

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.760
He picked me up on the way.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.920
What’s wrong?

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.080
Why do your trousers look so small?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.400
They’re his trousers. They’re so…

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.280
Ouch!

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.840
Shut up.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.360
He slept at my place last night.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.240
Huh?

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.800
Let’s get to work then.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.160
Fine.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.680
I already made an appointment with the barista. He was there on the day of the incident.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.440
(Cracked Sound)

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.760
What’s that sound?

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.240
It’s from me.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.440
Shit!

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.040
Geez, why didn’t you be more careful?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.440
It was your trousers.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.440
- They’re so fucking...
- Stop!

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.800
Just go and fix it.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.840
Your little brother is pointing at my face right now.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.040
I’ll go buy a new one then.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.800
Geez.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.040
I can still see it when I close my eyes.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.920
What?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.200
Nothing.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.120
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.120
About work.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.360
Let’s wait for Phaya first.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.080
What are you thinking? Nothing happened.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.280
I haven’t said anything.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.440
Sooo…

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.200
how was last night?

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.760
Last night, my foot.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.680
Let’s talk about work.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.040
That’s all we’ve got on the CCTV.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.440
Did you notice anything unusual on that day?

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.680
I’m afraid not.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.880
Please excuse me.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:55.960
According to the report, this is the place
where Miss Meena bumped into a man
and their phones got swapped.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.920
It also said that her car was parked in the blind spot.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.920
So, the CCTV couldn’t capture the person who kidnapped her.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.080
For the man whose phone got swapped with Miss Meena’s,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.000
she said she couldn’t see his face clearly...

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.200
because he was wearing a mask and a hoody.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.000
The police have already gathered all the evidence they could find here.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.160
The CCTV camera at the back of the shop is broken.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.280
So, there’s no other clues or evidence.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.240
Why are there so many coincidences?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.240
Or did he plan it all out?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.160
The man who kidnapped Miss Meena...

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.920
must know every single thing about her daily life.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.000
I’m sure he must make a mistake somewhere.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.800
Or something unexpected might happen...

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.400
that would make us able to find some clue here.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.080
Look at this place, it’s beautiful. The atmosphere is really nice too.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.000
Of course, or else many people wouldn’t be talking about it every single day.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.840
Three days ago,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.480
I was watching a review where the influencer came to eat the burnt cheesecake here.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.320
It looked so yummy that I wanted to have it too.
I’m so lucky it still hasn’t been sold out today.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.639
Then, can you film me while I’m making a content today?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.440
I want to do a review too.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.840
Sure. Give me your phone.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.800
Sure.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.719
Excuse me?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.199
I’m a special investigation officer.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.920
I’d like to ask you a few questions.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.120
Wait! Stop!

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.400
Isn’t this Miss Meena?

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.600
Oh! It’s really her.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.760
Play it.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.760
What I’m having here is the burnt cheescake...

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.160
which is a signature menu of this cafe.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.520
Wow, it smells so good.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.960
- Now, let’s...
- Stop!

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.880
...dig in...

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.640
Rewind back a little.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.760
See that man? The one with a hoody and a mask.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.520
He perfectly matches the description that Miss Meena told us.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.520
Let’s show this clip to Singh.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.520
He might be able to find out more clues from it.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.280
Let’s go back then.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.520
Too bad he was wearing a mask and a hoody.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.440
Otherwise, we could have seen his face.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.160
There’s a programme which allows you
to see more details of the person in the picture...

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.080
by using the facial instruction to create a rough profile of the eyes and the face structure.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.840
We then compare those information with our database in order to identify the identity of our suspect.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.720
Then do it.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.520
I want to do that too.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.520
But I’d need a few more days.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.400
We need to wait for the data from the CCTV cameras around the wood.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.720
So that we could be certain that our suspect was actually there on the day of the incident.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.480
That would lead us to where he took Miss Meena and locked her up.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.960
Damn it

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.760
This is Mayris, the head of forensic team. She’d help us with the case.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.320
I just introduced you to my team.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.760
Hello, my name is Mayris.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.160
They are all good looking this time.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.920
Quite worthwhile to sacrifice my sleep for finding the information.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.400
(Sigh) Please behave, Mayris.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.160
The rumour you created last time still hasn’t died down yet.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.440
Let’s see what you have got for us. Go ahead.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.680
I’ve looked at the medical records of our three victims.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.320
One of them was diagnosed with an allergy.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.960
I also found fungal spores in the victim’s lungs.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.640
So, I decided to examine the lungs of the other two victims.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.360
And found fungal spores in both of their lungs too.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.680
The place where the killer locked up the victims...

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.920
is probably somwhere very damp...

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.040
with poor or inadequate air ventilation.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.000
That’s why there are lots of fungus there.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:33.440
Our suspects also said that it’s a dark room which is very damp and hard to breathe.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.840
Is it possible that it might be a cellar?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600
Yes.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.680
It’s possible.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:49.240
About the irritating noise in the background,

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.160
I suspect it’s probably...

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.120
the area where we found the bodies.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.520
In the wood near the airport.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.160
The reason we couldn’t find any fingerprints or traces of secreation…

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.880
such as sweat or saliva of the killer on the victims’ bodies...

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.080
while all three suspects confirmed that...

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.560
the killer was also there when they were forced to torture the victims,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.400
I think it’s probably because…

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.000
our killer knows how to destroy and wipe out all the evidence.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.920
He knows how to destroy the evidence and also has access to the criminal data.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.720
Is it possible that he’s someone in our unit?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.000
All three victims were charged with sexual assaults.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.440
It’s impossible to know all the details about the victims just by watching the news.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.240
Unless he read it from our case files.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.160
- Singh. / - Yes, sir.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.600
Go and check the case-file access record of every officer in our unit.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.840
Find out who, within the past month...

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.960
had accessed to look at the case files of these three victims.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.200
Yes, sir.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.280
The rest of you...

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.560
go and find out more clues around the area of the crime scene.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:26.840
It’s possible that the killer might use
the area around the deserted wood to lock up and kill the victims.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.040
Yes, sir.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.040
This place used to be a part of the mental hospital.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.160
But it has been left deserted for so long...

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.640
so the druggies often come here to take refuge.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.400
There were also murders and suicides at this place.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.400
It’s quite similar to the Aokigahara forest in Japan.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.440
We better hurry up.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.800
Or else it’d get dark before we finish.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.080
Ouch!

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.480
What’s wrong?

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.600
I just sensed something.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.320
Let’s get to work.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.680
Cruel.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.480
Ouch!

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.080
It’s the noise that our suspects mentioned about.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.280
That room is probably around here.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.200
Let’s go then.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.360
Hey!

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.200
- Get down!
- (Screaming)

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.480
- (Screaming)
- Miss Mayris!

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.880
Tharn, look after her!

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.040
Ouch!

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.440
Stop!

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.040
Stop!

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.600
Stop!

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.720
I said stop!

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.440
Are you okay?

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.280
Miss Maris!

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.480
(Screaming)

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.400
I’m okay. Let’s get out of here.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.200
Go!

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.840
(Screaming)

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.880
How are we going to get out of here?

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.280
(Coughing)

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.400
Stop!

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.720
Stop!

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.200
I said stop!

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:07.960
Stop!

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.520
I said stop!
(Gunshot)

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.240
Freeze.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.520
Put your hands up.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.720
I said put your hands up.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.760
Now!

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.320
Slowly.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.000
(Fighting)

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.680
(Gunshot)

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.560
(Fighting)

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.640
(Gunshot)

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.800
Phaya.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.800
Miss Mayris, move!

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.040
Ahhhhh

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.560
Let’s go.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.560
(Coughing)

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.720
Please call for backup from our unit.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.080
And stay here. Don’t go anywhere.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.520
(Coughing)

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.480
Hello, I’d like to report an emergency case.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.600
There’s a fire at the mental hospital.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.560
(Fighting)

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.160
Hey!

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.360
Ouch!

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.400
Where is he?

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.600
(Gunshot)

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.520
Damn it!

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.800
Are you okay?

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.240
Yeah.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.880
My team and I came here
to find out more clues about the murder case.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.080
How’s the situation inside?

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.400
We were looking around in one room.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.120
Then a man in black appeared and threw a Molotov cocktail at us.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840
- Serg. / - Yes, sir.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.080
- Get our team and go inspect inside.
- Yes, sir.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.640
How is it?

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760
Stay still.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.760
I already am.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:51.920
Is it done?

00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.880
Thanks.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.800
Next time if you’re going to go after the culprit, don’t go alone like this.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.680
I couldn’t help it. I had to get him no matter what.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.840
Remember what the inspector used to tell us?

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.040
That you shouldn’t go solo.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.760
What if I couldn’t get there in time.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.680
Do you have any idea what would happen to you?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.640
Geez, don’t get so overreacted.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.880
If I got stabbed to death...

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.400
it was solely because of my own decision.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.520
It doesn’t have anything to do with you.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.920
Are you done?

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.360
I’m leaving.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.200
Hey.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.400
Don’t let me hear you talking about you being dead ever again.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.720
Well, I don’t want to interrupt but...

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.920
the inspector wants us to go back right now.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.040
So, what was that?

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.520
Did you have to grab his collar like that?

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.160
Is there anything I should know?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.000
Nothing.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.360
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Oh, sorry.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.600
Oops.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.120
I’m sorry.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.040
Tell me honestly, what happened there?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.320
Why are you so upset?

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.560
I already told you.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.000
Did you see the Sign about Phaya again?

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.680
Yeah.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.240
When I saw the Sign about other people,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.280
eventhough I couldn’t help them, I didn’t get so upset like when I saw the Sign about him...

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.800
and saw that he was about to die.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.760
Why?

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.440
Why do I care so much about him?

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.320
Why do I keep thinking of him?

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.840
Why do I feel so scared that he’d die?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.880
Are you that worried about him?

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.120
Damn it! If I were also there, he wouldn’t have been able to get away like this.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.360
This means the culprit is someone from our unit.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.160
That’s why he knew you and Tharn...

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.520
went to the crime scene with Miss Mayris.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.160
We’d find out soon. I already got his knife and gave it to the forensic team.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080
Inspector.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.200
Do we have the identity of the culprit?

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.280
They couldn’t find any fingerprints on the knife.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.680
What?

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.600
That’s impossible.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.160
He used that knife when we were fighting.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.440
And he didn’t wear gloves.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.280
Did the forensic team overlook something druing the test?

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.480
They insisted that they had rechecked it quite a number of times.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.880
But they still couldn’t find any fingerprints.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.320
Damn it!

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:06.920
Geez.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.200
What the heck!

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.720
Inspector.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.200
I’m sure that deserted building is where the culprit killed our victims.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.400
- Let’s get our team to inspect there.
- No.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.080
The building is almost destroyed during the fire.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.280
It’d be too dangerous to go into the cellar.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.720
Let’s wait until we hear from the crime scene officers.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.720
But...Inspector! Inspector!

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.760
We have only 4 days left.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.760
Meanwhile, we don’t know if he’s going to commit another murder like this.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.240
We have to go there.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.600
- And get the killer.
- I’m in.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.160
I know. I’ll be home soon.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.440
I’m on my way. Hold on.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440
(Dropping something)

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.520
Phaya.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.960
Dao.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.440
What brings you here?

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.440
Come here.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.080
When did you come back from France?

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.200
Since last week.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.560
But I didn’t want to bother you since you just started your new job.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.960
I’m meeting a friend around here today.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.640
So, I thought I could give you a surprise.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.600
But it turns out I’m the one who is more surprised.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.120
What is it?

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.760
- Here it is. / - Ouch!

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.440
Your grandma would surely give you an earful if she sees you like this.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.000
I’m begging you. Please don’t tell her about this.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.960
Please?

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.120
- Grandma…
- Come on. Please don’t tell her.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.320
I’m going to do anything for you. Pleaes don’t tell Grandma, okay?

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.400
- Pleaseee... / - Fine

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.480
Thank you.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.880
- You’re really... / - Ouch.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.880
You haven’t changed a bit.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.160
Are you still having a bad dream?

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440
Bad dream?

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.600
Yeah.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.640
But it’s getting a little weird these days.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:10.320
I kept dreaming of the same thing.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.440
Sometimes I can still see it while I’m awake.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.760
Are you still dreaming of that girl?

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.080
I think you should go see the doctor.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.720
Okay.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.960
Let’s take a picture of you for Grandma.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.920
- Hey. / - Huh?

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.120
Who do you think she is? Doesn’t she look familiar?

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.080
Stop it, Dao.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.520
You always love to tease me.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.880
Stop teasing me.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.560
Yeah, she does look familiar.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.680
Isn’t she the one who called him yesterday?

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.760
His girlfriend?

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.560
It’s his girlfriend then.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.000
They look so sweet.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.040
- Sweet couple. / - Are they?

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.680
Stop looking at Phaya.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.360
Let’s go home. It’s none of our business.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.640
Let’s go, baby

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.480
Why? Does it hurt to see him with someone else?

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.040
Ouch! You, asshole.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.240
- Go home. / - What a rascal brother.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.120
Oh, Dr. Cholathorn.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.520
Hello. Are you getting off work?

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.200
Yes.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.720
Are you here to pick up Tharn?

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.880
Yes, I’m going to drop him home.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.400
Well then, I’d get going.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.440
- See you, bro.
- See you.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.600
- See you.
- See you.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.680
Do you need to take care of anything before we leave?

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040
No.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.160
- Are you hungery?
- Yes.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.520
Then, let’s find something to eat before we go home, shall we?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.480
- Okay. / - Let’s go.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.920
Dao, I’ll be right back.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.720
Hey, where are you going?

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.840
Where are you guys going?

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.000
We’re going for dinner.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.200
Do you need anything?

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.800
Phaya.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.200
I’m leaving then.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.040
Okay. Please take care.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.760
- See you. / - Okay.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.680
Goodevening.

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.720
Goodevening.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.160
- Bye Bye. / - Bye Bye.

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.080
Your girlfriend is cute.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.640
You two are a perfect match.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.320
- Well, she’s...
- Ah, is she the one who often calls you?

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:53.960
Umm...

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.720
Let’s go then.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.560
Please wait.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.440
You said you’re going to have dinner, right?

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.600
I happen to be so famished.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.360
So, can I tag along too?

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.400
- Of course. / - No.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.960
Doc.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.520
Why not?

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.400
It’d be quite fun with lots of people at dinner

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.160
Also,

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.400
I think he has something to talk to me.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.200
You’re right.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.480
What about your bike?

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.920
I want to go by car today.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.920
Let’s go then, shall we?

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520
Let’s go.

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.160
That evil jellyfish.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.200
I heard your team is investigating on the rapists murder case.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.160
How is it going?

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.160
We almost got the culprit.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.280
- But then... / - I’m sorry.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.800
But this is strictly confidential.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.800
We can’t disclose its details to other people…

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.240
since it might jeopardize the case.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.360
I hope you catch the culprit as soon as possible.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.600
This case is a talk of the town at the moment.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.760
It must be tough for you...

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.760
to work on a case like this when you just started a job.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.120
Thank you.

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.160
Tharn, are you a cripple?

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.160
Why can’t you get the food yourself?

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:35.640
Phaya, if you’re not happy to eat with us...

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.400
please leave.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.840
I’m not done yet.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.120
I just had a bite or two.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.640
Please excuse me. I have to go to the loo.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.200
You’re probably still upset from work.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.600
If there’s anything I could help,

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.160
please let me know.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.160
Leave it to me. I can handle my own business.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.240
The culprit might have a mental disorder called Schizophrenia.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:17.480
The symptoms include hallucinations or delusions,
extremely disordered thinking and behaviour,
and abnormal interpretation of reality.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.880
Patients might not be aware of these symptoms in their daily lives.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.200
But they could be stimulated repetitively unitl the symptoms turn into a serious mental disorder.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.000
It could drive them to madness and hurting other people.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.480
You’d better have yourself checked up too.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.240
What do you mean?

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.240
I heard you often have bad dreams.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.920
Or seeing ghosts in your dream.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.920
Hearing voices, or thinking that something has happened when in fact nothing actually happens.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.120
Having hallucinations or delusions. Those are signs of mental disorder.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.200
If you don’t treat them in the earlystage,

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:59.240
it could affect not only your health but also your work and people around you.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.520
Tharn also has experienced a trauma which greatly affect his mental health.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.880
I’m just worried about you two because you have to work together.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.720
He told you about me?

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.920
(Cutlery clanging)

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.280
Hey, where are you going?

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.200
What happened?

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.600
Eight, Nine...

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.840
Are you slacking off?

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.320
Help me.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.320
Good. One more.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.080
- Okay / - You can do it

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.040
That’s good.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.480
Yeah.

00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.960
One more.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.480
Hey.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.280
(Boxing)

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.360
(Boxing)

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.000
What’s wrong with him?

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.720
Leave him be.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:23.840
Let’s go.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.200
Phaya.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.720
Hey.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.480
I’m talking to you. Can you hear me?

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.440
Ouch!

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.840
What’s wrong?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.800
What’s wrong with you?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.480
- What’s wrong?
- What’s wrong with YOU?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.400
Hey.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.720
- What the fuck’s wrong with you?
- Why did you do that?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.200
Why?!

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.320
- Hey!
- Why did you do that?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.920
Quit it!

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.480
Why did you do that?

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.280
What did I do?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.160
Do you think I’m nuts?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.320
That’s why you told that doctor of yours about my dream.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.560
What dream?

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.840
Hey, you guys! Come quick!
We found the genital.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.920
We found the genital.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.920
The Inspector calls for an urgent meeting.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.640
The Inspector calls for an urgent meeting.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.120
This morning, a bottle of three male genital organs was discovered in front of the office of Royal Police Bureau.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.080
Mayris and Wit are now examining the evidence to find out more clues...

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.720
in hope that we might be able to identify the cultprit.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.080
A group of women who used to fall victims to rapists...

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.360
(Riots)
are also gathering to protest against the bureau…

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.240
(Riots)
and demand that we must press serious charges to all the rape convicts.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.760
without pardoning or reducing the punishment.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.600
From our interview with these women...

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.040
they said they also received the video clips of our three victims being tortured.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.640
So, they are encouraged to call out for a better justice.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.040
He’s trying to provoke all the victims of sexual violence and use them to pressure us.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.480
Who is he?

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.640
I know who the culprit is.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.760
This is the picture of the culprit from the CCTV of the coffee shop.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.080
He’s now our prime suspect of three murders.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.000
I’ve used AI to help create the facial structure of this man.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.720
Then compared it with our criminal database.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.920
The result came up with a match.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.120
He looks similar to the man we saw...

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.920
from other CCTV cameras around the area of the wood where we found the victims’ bodies.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.840
A man wearing this kind of hat and driving a car without a license plate.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.640
Who’s this man?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.560
His name is Narong. He’s a forensic officer.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.800
According to the record in the past month...

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.600
he had accessed to look at a lot of case files...

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.360
especially the ones involving rapes and sexual assaults including the case of our three victims.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.400
So, Narong is the real culprit.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.160
Why would he kill those victims then?

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.320
What’s the motive?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.080
His younger sister got raped and killed herself.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.960
The culprit got away and wasn’t pressed with any charge.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.920
It’s the same as our murdered victims.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.680
Two of the three also got away without any charge.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.640
Inspector.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.240
I think we now have much enough evidence so let’s go and arrest him.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.320
Before he’d run away.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.200
That’s right. I agree with him, Inspector.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.960
Me too.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120
What did you see?

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.920
Hey, what is it? Hey!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.800
Singh, do you have the picture of the man who hurt Narong’s sister?

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.400
Yes.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:21.800
Here it is.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.040
His name is Songyod.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.760
Narong is not running away. He’s going to kill his last victim...

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.320
who is Songyod.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.160
Idolfactory

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.160
Shit!

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.040
Why are there two of you?

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.760
Please find the culprit and put him behind bars for me.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.440
Let me know if you need anything.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.440
I’d be more than willing to help.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.480
The security guard at the entrace said that...

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.080
there’s a car without a license plate...

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.720
parked not far away from our unit.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.920
Arghhhh!

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.360
Tharn!

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.560
Can you dig up an old case file for me?

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.520
What case?

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.000
The one about my father.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.440
If you don’t let go on the count of three...

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.840
I’m going to sleep right here.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.960
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:11.440
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:19.840
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:29.960
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:37.600
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.960
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.200
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:52.440
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.880
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:04.080
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
