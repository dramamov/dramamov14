00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunyue.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.800
I checked it.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
This 'Old Liu' mentioned by Wang Sheng

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600
is probably a fake identity.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.720
The phone wasn't registered

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.280
and the SIM card was likely discarded long ago.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.080
It seems now

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.120
that the Fox's plan in Yuji

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.560
was to kill two birds with one stone.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.220
Tu Guolin was also her target.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.720
The criminal organization behind Chi Xiao

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.920
must be quite substantial.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.120
The good news is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.650
their first attack failed.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.560
This indicates someone is working against them behind the scenes.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.400
I feel this criminal organization

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
might be connected to those people in my memories.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.080
Let's not overthink this now.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.880
Let's meet with Tu Guolin first.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.400
The only briefcase he brought is missing.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.160
The room key is here.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.920
The door wasn't locked.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920
The instant noodles weren't eaten.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.250
He left in quite a hurry.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.520
Alright.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.240
Wei,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.640
let's split up to search.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.440
Chi Xia,

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.800
go find Qu Bai again

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280
and see if you can get any information.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.920
Besides that Tu Guolin,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.080
ask him to find out

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.880
who this Liu guy is that's working with Wang Sheng.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.000
I got it.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.400
Both of you be careful.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
The signal in Yuji is unstable.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.920
Contact me as soon as possible if anything happens.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.720
You too.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.479
Goodbye.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.840
Officer Chi,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.300
are you looking for Mr. Qu?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.840
Do you know where he is?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.280
He has official business this afternoon.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.320
He took a car to the mountains in the south.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
There's no signal there.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.640
He asked me to tell you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.960
if you need to see him,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.090
please wait a while.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.360
I understand.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.000
Thank you.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.930
You're welcome.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.880
The investigation by Dongzhou police

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.280
has concluded.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.450
They've determined

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.000
it wasn't arson.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.440
Sir.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.680
If someone killed my parents.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
Then the murderer

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.960
must have planned it carefully.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.960
They must have strong counter-detection skills

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.560
and someone might be helping cover up the truth.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.720
What you've said

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.000
has no evidence so far.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.720
Hello.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.320
I'm a police officer.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.040
Hello.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.720
We need to use your vehicle right now.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.320
Please cooperate with us.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.800
Is that okay?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.440
Okay.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.529
Here's your helmet.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.130
Captain Luo.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.080
No need.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320
The repair shop has been completely trashed.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.360
Everyone's gone.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.360
I strongly suspect

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.320
that Tu Guolin has already left Yuji.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320
Didn't Wei order a thorough search?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400
If we can catch just one mechanic,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.480
we can definitely follow the trail

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.610
and find some leads.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.000
What's wrong, Captain Luo?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880
Someone lured Chi Xia to Bailong Resort

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.440
claiming they have something important to her.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.159
She insisted on going.

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.680
Asked us to provide backup once we see her.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.880
What about Tu Guolin?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.880
Have your men look for Tu Guolin.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.560
If there's any news,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.680
notify the police immediately.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.560
I'll go to the resort with Xiao Wei.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.360
Understood.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.560
Why aren't you here yet?

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760
Are you trying to starve me to death?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.080
Mr. Tu,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080
please calm down.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.680
It's so dark out here,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.080
and we can't turn on any lights.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.480
The place was hard to find.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.400
Please wait a moment,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.080
I'm almost there.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.760
Hurry up.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.560
Okay.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.159
Mr. Tu.

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.280
Were you followed?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.000
No.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.320
Be quicker next time.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.880
Yes, of course.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.520
Give me the food.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.159
Here.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.920
Now get out of here.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.720
Right away.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.880
Mr. Qu.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.200
Ms. Chi Xia came looking for you this afternoon.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.600
She seemed quite urgent.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.840
Phone.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.960
Thanks.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.890
You're welcome.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.680
Let's go.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.240
Captain Luo.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.840
Slow down.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.480
Watch out for the hole ahead.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.240
We've got a flat tire.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.170
What's going on?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.000
They're using the tactic of ambushing reinforcements.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.060
These bastards are playing military strategy with us.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.200
Wei.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.460
Grab your weapons.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.600
Let me remind you all.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.620
You're surrounding police officers right now.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.780
Do you know the consequences of assaulting an officer?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.840
Young Master.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.920
We have news.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.800
Chi Xia was deliberately lured back to Bailong Resort.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.600
Who?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.160
We don't have exact details.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.240
But our men reported.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.880
They saw Mo Laoqi going to Bailong Resort this afternoon.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.810
Apparently he installed homemade bombs in the room.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.040
Captain Luo.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.480
Wei.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.380
The bomb has two minutes left.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.300
Defuse it quickly!

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.840
Let me do it.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
Is it this wire?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.640
No.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.800
This one?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.260
This is the ignition wire.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.930
Fall back! Quickly!

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.160
A-De, get them to the hospital.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.640
Now!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.400
Chi Xia,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.240
wake up!

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.960
Chi Xia,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.640
wake up!

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.840
Chi Xia!

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.040
Chi Xia!

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.560
She's still breathing.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.560
Get help quickly!

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.080
Young Master.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.640
Fortunately, Chi Xia is only temporarily unconscious.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.640
She should wake up

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.840
after a night's rest.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160
Is your hand

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.520
all right?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.920
Chi Xia.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.760
After experiencing such trauma,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.960
she might recover some of her memories.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.680
Oh.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.840
By the way, Young Master,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.240
there's something else.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.200
When we were at Bailong Resort,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.840
Chi Xiao found Tu Guolin

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.000
and poisoned him.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.160
But the police arrived in time.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.800
Tu Guolin is now in the hospital,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.360
and he might survive.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.160
You're awake.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.460
Does your hand still hurt?

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.090
You're injured.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.160
I'm fine.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.360
Just a minor scratch.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.420
Let me tell you.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.320
Well.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.440
Those people who lured you there

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.050
must have planned this.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.280
Xiao Wei took a hit for me.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680
Mild concussion.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.040
Xiao Wei got hurt too?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640
But he'll be fine.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.130
A few days' rest will do.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.500
Please don't feel guilty.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.610
I'm the one who should feel guilty.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.920
Mr. Luo.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.340
I apologize to you.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.040
I shouldn't have

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.960
acted without understanding the situation

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.220
and rushed in blindly.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.360
It's all in the past now.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.620
Don't blame yourself.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.280
Thankfully,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.360
Qu Bai

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.920
arrived just in time.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.680
But anyway,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.200
why did you insist on going back to that resort?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.240
Because in that abandoned house

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.240
there were photos showing

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.040
Zhou's whereabouts before my parents' accident.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.480
I'm increasingly convinced

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.460
that my parents' death

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.170
was carefully planned by someone.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.880
And that explosive device

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360
was deliberately designed

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360
to jump directly

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.680
to 14 seconds once triggered.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.839
Why not 15 seconds, you think?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.319
Why not 10?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.839
Why specifically 14?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.520
She used to stay in Room 6.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.680
Ever since her daughter Zhou Wanrou stopped visiting,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.720
she insisted on moving to Room 14.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.319
Zheng Lanshu's Room 14.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.720
Not just that.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.119
The 2 PM class bell.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.720
And also,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.080
the invitation for October 14.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.920
These all appear repeatedly,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.450
but we've overlooked them.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.400
And also 12.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.080
The number twelve is also significant.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200
The village chief said

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.560
that inside this abandoned house...

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.440
I think there were only ten statues before.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240
Don't know why it became twelve.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.360
In the Bailong Resort,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.020
there were twelve statues forcibly assembled.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.720
I understand now.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.720
The number twelve in the Hundred Bones case...

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.960
Someone deliberately erased it

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.690
and intentionally left twelve graffiti pieces.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.000
So

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.560
14

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.600
12 and 25

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.810
were deliberately embedded in the murder cases.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.280
I'm afraid so.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.500
Did you remember something else?

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.320
It's very vague.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.160
But what I can confirm is

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.920
during a

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.240
survival test,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.360
my two friends and I

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.460
worked together to disarm an explosive device.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.440
One of them was a girl.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.340
But we had a falling out later.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.240
My intuition tells me

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.320
she is the Fox.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.720
Who was the other person?

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.440
Do you remember him?

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.920
Are you okay?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.920
I'm not sure.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.000
We found

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.920
an unfinished wooden carving of a cat

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.840
in his briefcase.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.080
There was also a small carving knife inside.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.800
It was a U-shaped carving knife.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.360
He is the real murderer who killed my parents.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.540
Water has a boiling point.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.200
People have principles.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.280
Don't cross the line.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.980
Are you coming?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.360
Let's find out.
