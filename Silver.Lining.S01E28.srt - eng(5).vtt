WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.080
Is Mo Laoqi in Dongzhou?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.160
Officer Chi.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.120
Last night,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.840
someone broke into Tu Guolin's hospital room,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.720
switched his medication,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.850
almost killing him.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.120
Fortunately, the police on duty caught the person.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.250
Okay, I understand.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.640
What's wrong?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.200
Last night someone switched medications

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.640
to attempt to assassinate Tu Guolin.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.570
But the person disguised as a doctor has been caught.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.200
Good that he's safe.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.479
Let's focus on the current case first.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.880
We'll interrogate them thoroughly later.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.160
This

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
is Tao Han's medical record from that time.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.600
This

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.960
is from after the treatment was completed.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.280
The payment receipt signed by Tao Han

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.680
The time was right after the accident.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
And the location was

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.600
the Second People's Hospital nearest to the accident site.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.400
Good.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320
This is solid evidence.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.640
The strangulation marks were indeed on Tao Han.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.600
So his father must have

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.280
arrived at the scene afterward.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.480
Lu Ningzhi couldn't have been unaware.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.720
But she tacitly accepted

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720
her father's killer going unpunished.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.320
There must be something fishy going on.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.400
Just as I thought.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.340
But none of them will get away.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.160
Notify everyone.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.240
We're arresting Tao Han.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.900
Notify and summon Lu Ningzhi.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.480
Before Lu Ningzhi left,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.010
did she say anything to you?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.440
She didn't say anything.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.840
When I woke up in the middle of the night,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.320
she was already gone.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.620
How's it going?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.960
Have you found Lu Ningzhi?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.560
I checked the neighborhood surveillance footage.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.440
Lu Ningzhi did

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.400
leave alone at 3 AM this morning.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.480
Her phone is turned off

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.280
and we can't reach her.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.960
I see.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.680
I just got news from Forensics.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.480
Tao Han's phone signal was detected

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.360
five minutes ago

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.160
near the yoga studio owned by Lu Ningzhi.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.120
I think these two are likely together.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.800
Here's the plan.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.160
My senior and I will head there now.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.960
You all come too,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.680
okay?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.480
Okay.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.040
Let's go.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.120
Who is it?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.000
Property management.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.280
Open the door, Pan.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.240
I'm busy trying to catch Tao Han.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.440
Don't bother me unless it's urgent.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.920
Wait, wait.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.120
I have great news for you.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.480
We've caught Pan Haili.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.320
The fake Pan Haili.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.120
That was fast.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.440
How did you catch her?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.160
Heizi.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
He located her position first.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.960
Then we found someone.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.480
Someone the fake Pan Haili trusted to help us.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.480
The whole operation went smoothly.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.600
Who is it?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.600
Property management.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.320
Open the door.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.000
Pan.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.880
Pan.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.330
What do you want?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.200
Police!

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.240
Don't run!

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.960
Police!

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.080
Well done!

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.400
Take them to the station.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.280
We've arrived at Lu Ningzhi's yoga studio.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.010
We'll round them all up at once.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.080
Well, you're quite impressive, kid.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.480
We've been after them for so long without success,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.810
how did you locate them?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.970
All thanks to Captain Luo's leads.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.440
The property management company responsible for that area

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.480
is all connected.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.200
Captain Luo asked me to communicate with them.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.060
Eventually, I followed the trail

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.680
and found the person who brought the fake Pan Haili

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.160
to work at the property management company.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.720
With that person's cooperation,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.160
we were able to figure out

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.820
the fake Pan Haili's address.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.840
That wasn't easy.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.720
Right.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.920
We can't let all this effort go to waste,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.920
right, Bin?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.960
Let's interrogate them thoroughly later.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.880
You and me, Bin.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.600
You got it.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.290
Captain Luo is back.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.880
Captain Luo,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.840
what happened?

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.980
Two suspects got away.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.560
What a shame.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.159
The surveillance setup wasn't complete.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.220
We couldn't track them immediately.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.600
At least we caught the fake Pan Haili.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Take it slow.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.250
Captain Luo.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.250
You're just in time.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.840
Cao Bin and I will handle the interrogation.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.960
The rest of you go find Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.360
No.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.960
No need to look for them.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.120
That's what I came to tell you.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.920
They just turned themselves in.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.360
Who?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.000
Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.200
They came together?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.000
Yes.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.080
Tao Han confessed to hit-and-run,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.480
arson and murder.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.460
Lu Ningzhi just accompanied him.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.360
Interesting.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.480
Let's interrogate them together.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.740
See what they're up to.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.000
Prepare the files.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.800
Got it.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.760
Thanks.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.840
We meet again.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.520
Officer Chi,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.520
feel free to ask whatever you want.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.600
I actually quite like you.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.160
I quite like you too.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.840
I like

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.770
the surprises you bring me.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.490
But I don't really like surprises.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.120
What I hope Officer Chi can bring me

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.920
is fairness and justice.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.200
My duty is to handle cases according to law.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.800
As for the final outcome,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.730
whether it matches your idea of fairness and justice

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.159
depends on what the truth really is.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.040
Of course.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.000
I'll do my best to cooperate with you, Officer Chi.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.120
That's great.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.700
Let's start by discussing

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.960
why you accompanied Tao Han to turn himself in.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.560
That day,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.320
I was overseeing the renovation at the yoga studio until dawn.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.380
Tao Han suddenly came looking for me.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.000
What are you doing?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.360
Tao Han.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.890
Ning Zhi.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360
It's all my fault.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.560
I just couldn't stand by

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.800
watching Fang Xiaofeng and Dong Chengbin

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.130
bullying you like that.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.280
What did you do?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.000
They deserve it.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.440
Why are you so foolish?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.240
Ningzhi.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.840
All these years, I've been filled with regret.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.920
If I hadn't been

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.930
so impulsive back then,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.040
causing a deep

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.600
blood feud between us,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800
how could we

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.160
possibly not be together?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680
I know.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.440
I know all these years

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.160
you've been protecting me.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.360
Every time I feel

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.120
you near me,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.320
my heart aches.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.640
I really...

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.880
I...

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.760
I never asked you to save me.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.560
You really don't have to do this.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.880
But Ningzhi,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.320
when I dealt with everyone

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.600
who ever hurt you,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.720
I felt that was my purpose for living.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.400
I know.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.400
I've caused you trouble this time.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.600
But my life belongs to you.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.280
If you want to punish me,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.800
you can take it right now.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.960
I have no right to punish you.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760
Only the law does.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.600
Don't worry.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.900
I'll give you an explanation.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.040
Do you know that Tao Han is

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.570
the real killer who ran over your stepfather?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.080
After all, it was

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.920
a horrific scene.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.880
Back then, Ningzhi

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.530
couldn't handle such a situation.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.080
She was shocked

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.760
and grief-stricken,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.000
so she fainted.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.200
She didn't notice that I was the one who hit him.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.730
According to what you said,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.760
you acted on impulse.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.340
Lu Ningzhi didn't see you hit the person,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.240
and then your father took the blame for you.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.280
After that, when Lu Ningzhi asked about it,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.200
how did you explain it to her?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.000
At first,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.170
I didn't dare to see her.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.050
I only told her the truth recently.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.360
After

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.960
killing Fang Xiaofeng

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.240
and Dong Chengbin,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.320
Tell me the details of how you committed the crime.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.360
I snuck in through

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.330
a blind spot in the surveillance cameras.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.400
I had seen

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.970
Lu Ningzhi enter the door code before,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.040
so I knew their password.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.400
After I got inside.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.960
Who are you?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.920
I rushed at him first

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.180
and injected the intoxicated Fang Xiaofeng with the drug.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.760
Then I stabbed him.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.840
Then I used his phone

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.930
to send blackmail messages to Dong Chengbin.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.440
To lure him over.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.080
I was hiding

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.120
behind the door, waiting.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.600
As soon as Dong Chengbin entered,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.400
I took him down

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320
using the same method.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.720
Then,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.760
I set a fire.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.560
I escaped

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.880
the same way I came in.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.040
Why did you kill them?

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.480
Is someone behind this?

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.360
I wanted to kill them myself.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.080
Nobody told me to do it.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.600
Then how did you know

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.000
about the blind spots in the surveillance?

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.360
Pan Haili from property management told me.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.600
I don't know why she wanted to help me.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.360
Maybe

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.340
she noticed I was always following Ningzhi.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.080
One day she suddenly

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.640
came to me.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640
She said she could

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.000
help me

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.100
avoid the cameras.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.280
You trusted her that easily?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.200
Besides that,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.680
did she tell you anything else?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.810
Elementary school.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.420
Chi Xiao gave me very detailed information.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.880
About the history between Tao Han

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.280
and Lu Ningzhi.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.640
I know everything.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.760
So persuading and guiding Tao Han

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.160
was an easy task.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.520
Who is Chi Xiao?

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.160
I don't know if Chi Xiao

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.720
is her real name.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.580
But that's what the executives call her.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360
The subordinates

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.000
usually call her Fox.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.760
The group?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.560
What group?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.450
I don't know the full name of the group.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.760
I only know

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.400
the top decision-maker is called Old K.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.320
So you're saying that the person who instructed you

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.200
to pose as a caregiver at the nursing home

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.880
and to work at the property management office this time

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.480
was Chi Xiao?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.080
Yes.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.800
Then what about the numbers?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.440
The 25-second video,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.920
the wallpaper with '25' in English,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.160
the 12 graffiti pieces,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.360
the book titled '12,'

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.400
and the room that Zheng Lanshu insisted on moving into -

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.040
Room 14.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.840
What's going on with all of this?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.240
I don't know.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.410
I just followed Chi Xiao's instructions.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.000
She wouldn't let me ask too many questions.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.700
What about 14 then?

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.810
Why didn't 14 appear this time?

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.040
Or did you hide it somewhere?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.440
There's no 14

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.400
because Chi Xiao didn't tell me

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.930
that we needed 14 this time.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.720
Now tell me clearly

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.080
how you and Lu Ningzhi planned this.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.160
Pan Haili?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760
Who's Pan Haili?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.220
I don't know her

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.660
and have never met her.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.040
Officer Chi,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.840
I've said many times,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.400
I really just want to live

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.800
a quiet life of my own.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.160
When Fang Xiaofeng was abusing you,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.220
did you just want to live a quiet life?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.120
Yes.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.040
When Zhu Chongliang was stalking you,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.880
did you just want to live a quiet life?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.400
Yes.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.600
When Dong Chengbin assaulted you,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.560
did you also just want to live a quiet life?

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.360
No.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.240
I wanted to kill him,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.200
grind his bones to dust,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.840
cut him into pieces.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.440
I...

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.650
Do you like psychology?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.080
Studying the human mind,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.480
manipulating people's hearts,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.320
sometimes it's quite interesting,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.120
isn't it?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.040
You don't necessarily need to be interested to learn something.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.500
Everyone has their flaws.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.380
Everyone has weaknesses.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.800
As long as you identify those weaknesses,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.860
you can use anyone to your advantage.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200
Just like Tao Han.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.320
Please confirm this.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.000
Sign here.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.920
Why did you buy so many things?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.720
Is it heavy?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.560
It's fine.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.200
You should have asked me.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.480
Officer Chi.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.560
If you don't have any other questions,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.720
I need to leave now.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.120
There's still a lot to do at the yoga studio.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.440
Of course.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.260
You can leave anytime.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.890
The law says I can't keep you here too long.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.600
But Fang Xiaofeng,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.640
Tao Han,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.680
Dong Chengbin,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.170
Zhu Chongliang,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.610
What about them?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.080
Whether they were good people

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080
or bad people,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.160
whether they deserved it

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.440
or were misunderstood,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.570
they can never walk out of there again.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.660
Are you at peace with that?

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.640
Everyone has to pay

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.000
for their immature emotions.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.640
I'm no exception.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.440
Am I?

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.890
As for whether I'm at peace,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.460
it doesn't matter.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.120
If someone is evil,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.360
evil deeds will be repaid with evil.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.800
Ms. Lu.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.800
Have you never thought about killing them?

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.800
Watching them helpless before you,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.200
engulfed in flames,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.600
unable to move.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.360
And you,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.160
being the god who watches them with indifference.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.840
Have you really never thought about it?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.120
Of course I have.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.160
But I'm just a person,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.520
not a god.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.480
Officer Chi,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.560
goodbye.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.480
Someone who incites others to kill

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.000
and escapes legal punishment.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.320
I kill whenever I want.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.720
He typically holds a knife with his right hand,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.920
but you use your left.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.360
Without his orders,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.930
you wouldn't dare kill.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.200
I was your target from the beginning, wasn't I?

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200
Don't look back.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.240
Keep walking.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.880
Little Fox,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.120
you must survive.
