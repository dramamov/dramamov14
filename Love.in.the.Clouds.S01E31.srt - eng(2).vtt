00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:31.265
ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:41.465
What about that child?

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:45.745
You mean

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:48.345
my child?

00:01:57.865 --> 00:01:59.545
He is dead.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.185
Back then, I ordered Bo Yulan
to take him somewhere safe

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:05.385
and protect him well.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:08.505
But who could have known?

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:14.345
He died

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.505
on the way.

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:22.705
Retribution.

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.185
Retribution.

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.385
All of it is retribution.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:37.945
He died?

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:52.785
That is the whole truth.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:56.625
I have told you everything
you wanted to know.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:00.865
You are not the real Ming Xian.
You are not my child.

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:02.625
The strict training, the harshness,

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:04.025
and the obsession with victory and defeat

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:05.065
were all because

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.065
you were merely
a tool to secure my position.

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:12.865
From the very beginning, I never once
saw you as my own child,

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.905
so I will not leave with you.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:19.705
Go.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:23.545
The fact that you are still alive now

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:26.985
means you have found a way
to suppress the Heavenly Grief.

00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:32.545
Find a place and live in peace.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:44.145
Ming Xin will soon be
officially named Crown Prince.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.265
Everything is set in stone.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:49.825
To me

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:52.625
and to Yaoguang Mountain,

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:57.905
you are no longer of use.

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:16.785
Mother…

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:22.425
Someone's coming.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:25.145
Master She has gone to hold them off.

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:26.105
We must leave at once.

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:33.265
Let's go.

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.465
Ming Xian?

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:34.025
Ming Xian!

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:03.225
Let's go.

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:12.665
-Find the intruders in Yaoguang Palace!
-There's an ambush.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:14.345
They've taken Xin!

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:16.385
Don't let them leave
Yaoguang Palace alive!

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:17.425
It's Madam Meng.

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:22.105
Could we please leave now?

00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:29.225
You little rascal!
How many times have I told you

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.705
not to go back on impulse?

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:32.985
Why can't you ever listen?

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.665
No matter what happens, you just shake
that useless Messenger Bell!

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:38.665
Do you know how busy I am?

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:40.585
I've been running back
and forth because of you!

00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:44.705
-Master She.
-What now?

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:47.745
I'm scolding my disciple.
Why are you stopping me?

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.745
Let go. If you don't, I'll hit you too!

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.665
What are you doing?

00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:05.225
Looking all pitiful won't stop me
from punishing you.

00:07:05.305 --> 00:07:06.145
I…

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:18.225
Oh my, I stewed a hen for you,
and now it's almost burned!

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:19.625
I know everything now.

00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:24.585
Stop running, Old Man She.

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:27.865
Whenever you sneaked me scallion pancakes,

00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:29.705
Mother would punish me.

00:07:29.785 --> 00:07:32.025
I thought she only
feared I'd grow spoiled.

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:35.145
But now I know she was afraid

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:37.185
that if I got too close to you, I'd see

00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:38.265
that the way you treated me

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:41.665
was how real parents
would treat their child.

00:07:48.305 --> 00:07:50.065
You…

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:54.705
you're my real…

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:58.505
my… my real…

00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:19.145
Come.

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.185
I'll take you somewhere.

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:40.264
The Bo clan's ancestral home?
Zhangwei Mountain?

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:42.264
Isn't it said that only
descendants of the Bo clan can enter?

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:45.385
I built this place.

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:47.785
Master,

00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:52.585
you… you built an exact replica of
the Bo clan's ancestral home?

00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:56.305
I couldn't enter the real one,

00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:58.825
so this was the only way

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:04.145
I could have
a residence that belonged to her.

00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:06.065
Here,

00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:08.385
I can preserve

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:11.345
the most precious
memories of your mother and me.

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:18.225
Come on.

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.905
Here, my child.

00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:25.865
Years ago, your mother Bo Yucen

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:27.825
and her sister Bo Yulan

00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:29.945
escaped from Zhangwei Mountain.

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:32.585
By chance, I saved them.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:37.665
Then your mother and I grew close,

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:39.465
and in time,

00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:42.545
we had you.

00:10:45.105 --> 00:10:48.185
But misfortune struck.
The Empress discovered our relationship.

00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:53.225
For a warrior to consort with a fairy
from another realm was a grave offense.

00:10:54.425 --> 00:10:55.945
I was thrown into prison.

00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:58.945
By the time I was released,

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.825
it'd become far too
late to change anything.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:03.545
You

00:11:04.225 --> 00:11:07.625
had been recognized by
the Emperor as his eldest son,

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.945
and there was no turning back.

00:11:11.585 --> 00:11:13.385
I could only promise the Empress

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.705
that I would never
to reveal the truth to you

00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:18.225
in exchange for
a chance to stay by your side.

00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:20.225
So,

00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:22.265
I trained tirelessly,

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:24.305
rising from an ordinary warrior

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:27.265
to the Venerable of the warrior ranks,

00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:31.345
and eventually, your master.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.065
I remember

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:38.065
◘you once said you knew
nothing of forging artifacts.

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.585
And since Yaoguang Mountain
despised such craft,

00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:42.665
there was no skilled
Forger who could teach me.

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:46.465
But I loved forging.

00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:51.305
So you studied it on your own,

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.545
just so I could learn more.

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:57.865
You gave me all the best things.

00:11:58.545 --> 00:11:59.945
How could I not have known…?

00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:15.705
Father.

00:12:34.225 --> 00:12:35.145
Daughter.

00:12:41.265 --> 00:12:42.105
My daughter.

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:44.505
Father.

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.225
Yucen, did you hear that?

00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:53.465
This is our daughter.

00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:00.025
Daughter.

00:13:02.545 --> 00:13:04.025
My daughter!

00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:09.225
Do you know

00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:12.305
what I've been through all these years?

00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:16.105
Do you have any idea?

00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:18.345
Old Man She, this is the first time
I've seen you cry like this.

00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:21.345
Don't cry, Father.

00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:28.545
This is so embarrassing.
I must not cry. It's too embarrassing.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:30.425
A father shouldn't cry like this.

00:13:34.545 --> 00:13:35.505
It's not embarrassing.

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:43.265
I feel like I forgot something important.

00:13:43.345 --> 00:13:44.345
Right.

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.465
You wrote in your message

00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:49.945
that Ming Xin had been colluding
with Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:50.865
Is that true?

00:13:50.945 --> 00:13:52.225
I sensed the spiritual power

00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:54.225
of Zhushui Spiritual State
within his spiritual veins.

00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:55.545
He also admitted it himself

00:13:56.825 --> 00:13:59.505
that the Emperor of
Zhushui told him about my identity.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.745
Then… isn't this bad?

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.345
If the Emperor of
Zhushui knows who you are,

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.705
he will surely take action.

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.225
And there's something even worse.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.665
Ming Xin and the Emperor
of Zhushui are working together.

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:17.465
If Ming Xin truly becomes Crown Prince,

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:18.745
Yaoguang Mountain will be doomed.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:22.105
And two days from now,

00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:23.705
Father will hold
Ming Xin's investiture ceremony.

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:26.265
Yes, he has fallen into our hands,

00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:27.505
but I am not Ming Xian.

00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:29.185
Even if we bring him down,

00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:30.505
what will become of Yaoguang Mountain?

00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:03.225
The Emperor of Zhushui
had Mu Qibai raise netherbeasts

00:15:03.745 --> 00:15:05.865
and has already gained immense power.

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:07.665
Why is he still going
to such lengths to make

00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:09.545
the Heavenly Grief and
the Golden Millet Dream?

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:12.105
What else do you know?

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.905
I've told you everything I know!

00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:24.985
Ji Bozai, you animal!

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.865
Is the Soul-seizing Technique
the only thing you can use?

00:15:28.585 --> 00:15:29.945
Not necessarily.

00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:31.265
There are plenty more
ways to make you suffer.

00:15:34.985 --> 00:15:36.745
I came from the Sunken Abyss.

00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:39.425
That place has no
shortage of torture methods.

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:41.585
The most unique one

00:15:41.665 --> 00:15:44.465
is burning someone with Phantom Fire.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:48.505
Your skin will be peeled away bit by bit,

00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:50.785
rotting and scabbing

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:52.985
over and over again,

00:15:53.905 --> 00:15:56.585
until a scar
that can never heal is formed.

00:15:59.865 --> 00:16:00.745
Here it is.

00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:03.345
Want to try it?

00:16:07.545 --> 00:16:08.785
No…

00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.105
I'll talk!

00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:17.425
I think they have another plan anyway.

00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.585
The Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream

00:16:19.665 --> 00:16:22.625
aren't just
for winning the Qingyun Tournament.

00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:25.065
Right,

00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:27.745
I once overheard them talking

00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:30.625
about something inside the Zhuojin Tower,

00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:34.425
something called
the Sky-Swallowing Array, I think.

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.065
That's all I know.

00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:39.545
Would they really share their secrets
with an outsider like me?

00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:41.985
You should've said that sooner.

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:48.665
Come to think of it,

00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:51.065
since I am not the real Ming Xian,

00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:54.345
I have no ties
to Yaoguang Mountain anymore,

00:16:56.305 --> 00:16:57.225
which means

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:00.225
its future has nothing to do with me now.

00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:03.145
None of this concerns me now.

00:17:09.345 --> 00:17:11.464
If even the Warrior Goddess
who brought it seven consecutive victories

00:17:11.545 --> 00:17:12.585
has no say in its future,

00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:13.944
then who has?

00:17:15.224 --> 00:17:16.464
Ming Yi and Ming Xian.

00:17:16.545 --> 00:17:19.065
Those are just names.

00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:22.025
You grew up as Ming Xian, didn't you?

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:23.385
True, you are not the Empress's son,

00:17:23.464 --> 00:17:24.585
but wasn't it you who fought

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.424
for Yaoguang Mountain
and protected its people?

00:17:27.065 --> 00:17:29.065
You wish to fight for
peace among the Six Realms

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:31.345
and make the Qingyun Tournament
fair again.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.465
Are you going to give up
just because you're not Ming Xian?

00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:41.505
Whether you are a foolish girl

00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:43.265
or a reckless boy,

00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:46.905
a wise fairy or a stubborn fool,

00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:48.105
what difference does it make?

00:17:48.905 --> 00:17:51.185
As long as you can face heaven
and earth with no shame in your heart,

00:17:51.265 --> 00:17:52.545
you are who you are.

00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:01.145
Ming Yi.

00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:09.825
Remember this:

00:18:10.665 --> 00:18:12.785
you are my disciple,

00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:16.505
the best child
your mother and I could've hoped for,

00:18:16.585 --> 00:18:18.505
and someone with an unyielding spirit.

00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:22.225
Do you understand?

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:44.345
I took the portrait of Fairy Bo
and visited the places she had once been.

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:47.545
To my surprise, someone
at the border of Yaoguang recognized her.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.385
They said that when Fairy Bo was alive,

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:51.105
she often came there to gather herbs

00:18:51.185 --> 00:18:53.385
and would ask about a child
with a mark between his brows.

00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:56.945
So,

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:00.625
when Master saved
me from the Sunken Abyss,

00:19:01.305 --> 00:19:02.385
it wasn't by chance.

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:05.545
Perhaps Fairy Bo always knew

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.185
who you truly were.

00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:09.705
Then maybe

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:13.545
when Master said she owed me,

00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:17.585
it wasn't just because
she kept secrets from me,

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.305
but also because…

00:19:23.785 --> 00:19:25.865
After Fairy Bo gave me the recipe,

00:19:25.945 --> 00:19:27.585
I begged her to meet with you.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:29.305
But she said she owed you,

00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:32.425
and that she'd hidden
the truth right before your eyes,

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.185
somewhere within your reach.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:36.705
But the truth was unbearable.

00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:38.185
She feared that once you learned it,

00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:40.185
you would lose faith
in people and in the world.

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:44.265
Somewhere within my reach?

00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:53.105
Father, did you say

00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:57.625
this place held the most precious memories
of you and Mother?

00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:02.225
The portraits left
behind by the Bo clan after death

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:05.145
carry the memories of their owners.

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:08.905
The memories of how your mother and I met

00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:11.385
are within this painting.

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:22.185
Master said the truth

00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:26.465
was somewhere within my reach.

00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:09.225
If not for you,

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.425
the Empress would never
have plotted to take my sister's child.

00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:28.105
Father, do you know

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.545
if the child Fairy Bo Yulan sent away,

00:21:31.065 --> 00:21:32.265
the Empress's own son,

00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:34.025
really died?

00:21:34.705 --> 00:21:37.785
When Yulan returned,
she told the Empress herself

00:21:38.385 --> 00:21:42.345
that the child did
not survive the journey.

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:47.345
I escorted the young
prince away as ordered,

00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:52.625
but he was too frail.

00:21:54.185 --> 00:21:55.425
He died

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:57.745
on the way.

00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:01.385
I failed in my duty.

00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:03.505
Punish me as you will.

00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:16.065
Retribution.

00:22:20.265 --> 00:22:22.305
It is retribution indeed.

00:22:29.705 --> 00:22:30.865
Retribution!

00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:35.905
But Mother and I

00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:38.425
were her last
remaining family in the world.

00:22:39.105 --> 00:22:40.865
Mother died giving birth,

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:43.385
and the Empress took me in as her own.

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.905
Did she really accept that task willingly,

00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:47.345
without a single word of complaint?

00:22:48.425 --> 00:22:51.065
The Empress used you as leverage.
She had no choice but to obey.

00:22:52.945 --> 00:22:54.345
After learning the child had died,

00:22:55.385 --> 00:22:58.665
the Empress once searched for
a child with a mark between the brows,

00:22:59.265 --> 00:23:01.985
but she found none
that bore her son's presence.

00:23:04.745 --> 00:23:06.985
You once said you had
a mark on your forehead.

00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:17.625
I think

00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:21.545
my mother planted it there
when I was still an infant.

00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:27.865
It holds some vague memories of her.

00:23:30.105 --> 00:23:31.865
I can't see her face clearly,

00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:35.185
but she told me

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:37.025
this mark

00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:39.585
was formed from her blood and mine.

00:23:40.825 --> 00:23:42.065
I, too, once suspected

00:23:42.145 --> 00:23:45.545
that Yulan might have killed that child.

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:47.025
The Empress had her doubts as well.

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:49.025
But

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:51.705
since you were the Empress's only hope,

00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:54.545
they each had something to lose

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.425
and could no longer
turn against each other.

00:23:57.585 --> 00:23:59.905
What is that mark between the brows?

00:24:01.865 --> 00:24:04.345
The Empress wished to reunite
with her own son one day,

00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:08.265
so she left
a Tracing Mark between his brows.

00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:10.745
Then could Fairy Bo

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:15.265
have temporarily sealed that mark,

00:24:15.345 --> 00:24:17.625
causing the Empress to
believe her child had died?

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.145
With the Bo clan's arts,

00:24:21.705 --> 00:24:23.425
it could be done for a short while.

00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:39.625
Your Lordship, you are actually
the son of the Empress of Yaoguang.

00:25:41.705 --> 00:25:43.345
Fairy Bo risked her life to save you,

00:25:43.945 --> 00:25:45.705
yet it was she herself
who abandoned you back then,

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:48.425
leaving you to grow up in the Sunken Abyss

00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:50.265
as a prisoner.

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:05.985
Yesterday, my husband went
to the Sunken Abyss to deliver food.

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.105
He said he saw a poor child down there.

00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:10.905
He looked barely ten years old.

00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:12.105
Right.

00:26:12.185 --> 00:26:13.865
I heard he'd been
there since he was little.

00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.585
He must've been taken there.

00:26:17.705 --> 00:26:19.265
When they beat him,

00:26:19.345 --> 00:26:21.625
didn't a mark appear on his forehead?

00:26:22.185 --> 00:26:23.425
Yes.

00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:26.065
But it didn't seem
like the overseers left it there.

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.505
Maybe his family did.

00:26:30.145 --> 00:26:31.385
That makes sense.

00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:34.785
-Come on, let's gather herbs over there.
-All right.

00:26:56.665 --> 00:27:00.865
I must find him and atone for my sin.

00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:16.985
The portrait caught fire on its own.

00:27:18.425 --> 00:27:19.345
Your Lordship.

00:27:50.185 --> 00:27:52.745
Your Lordship, your heart
imprint resonated with Ming Yi's.

00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:56.505
You're doing this
so she wouldn't see this, right?

00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:16.385
Your Lordship.

00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:18.385
There have been signs
that the Heavenly Grief in you

00:28:18.465 --> 00:28:19.825
might stir again.

00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:22.585
You must take care of yourself.

00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:28.985
I'm fine.

00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:38.945
Wait!

00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:45.185
You came after all.

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:47.985
I never thought

00:30:49.505 --> 00:30:51.265
I would see you again.

00:30:52.825 --> 00:30:54.105
Why are you turning away?

00:30:57.825 --> 00:30:59.625
What I came to confirm

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:01.905
has already been confirmed.

00:31:08.225 --> 00:31:09.905
It was my fault.

00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:13.665
I truly believed

00:31:15.905 --> 00:31:17.745
that you were gone.

00:31:19.985 --> 00:31:21.145
I heard

00:31:21.705 --> 00:31:23.385
you had fallen into the Sunken Abyss.

00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:26.865
Do you not want to see me

00:31:28.745 --> 00:31:31.305
because you still resent me?

00:31:54.865 --> 00:31:55.705
I hold no resentment.

00:31:57.065 --> 00:31:59.705
I lived 20 years
without my parents around.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:01.625
Meeting you today

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:03.865
was unexpected for me as well.

00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:06.145
But right now, you are just

00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:09.665
a stranger in my eyes.

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:14.745
I know

00:32:16.385 --> 00:32:18.465
I have failed as a mother.

00:32:21.065 --> 00:32:23.465
But tell me, is there
anything I can still do for you?

00:32:35.185 --> 00:32:36.065
Ming…

00:32:39.105 --> 00:32:39.985
My child…

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:51.785
Your Lordship,

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:54.865
as you instructed,

00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:56.185
I turned a blind eye

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:57.825
and let Madam Meng rescue Ming Xin.

00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:02.105
The investiture ceremony is approaching.

00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:03.385
Letting him escape

00:33:03.945 --> 00:33:05.505
is necessary for my next move.

00:33:08.385 --> 00:33:10.865
Your Lordship already has a plan in mind.
It is not my place to say more.

00:33:12.065 --> 00:33:13.265
But please remember this:

00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:14.985
no matter what happens,

00:33:15.065 --> 00:33:16.265
you must not open the Spirit Well

00:33:16.345 --> 00:33:18.225
until your spiritual
power is fully restored.

00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:20.345
Otherwise,

00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:22.385
you might really suffer a relapse.

00:33:31.265 --> 00:33:32.105
Everyone,

00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:34.425
today is the Sunlight Festival.

00:33:34.505 --> 00:33:37.865
We give thanks to the gods for blessing
Yaoguang Mountain with the gift of light.

00:33:38.545 --> 00:33:42.105
Today also marks
the investiture ceremony of Ming Xin.

00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:43.665
From this day forth,

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:47.745
Lord Chengyun will be formally
named Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

00:33:48.665 --> 00:33:51.745
and assume the post of
Honorary Warrior of the warrior ranks.

00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:52.905
This decision is final.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.425
Wait!

00:33:59.545 --> 00:34:01.145
-Who is that?
-No idea.

00:34:01.825 --> 00:34:02.745
What's going on?

00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:06.905
-That mask…
-That's Ming Xian's mask.

00:34:06.985 --> 00:34:08.905
-That's strange.
-But this is a fairy.

00:34:08.985 --> 00:34:10.465
Right. Is she…?

00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:12.425
Why is she wearing Ming Xian's mask?

00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:13.465
Is she Ming Xian?

00:34:13.545 --> 00:34:14.865
-I don't know.
-Ming Xian?

00:34:14.945 --> 00:34:16.505
-Who is she really?
-Is she Ming Xian?

00:34:16.585 --> 00:34:17.784
-I don't think so.
-She… She…

00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:20.225
-Isn't that a fairy?
-Yeah.

00:34:20.304 --> 00:34:21.145
That's a fairy.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:24.865
-But why is she wearing Ming Xian's mask?
-Ming Xian?

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:29.025
-She really is Ming Xian!
-She's Ming Xian?

00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:29.945
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:34:30.025 --> 00:34:32.225
-How can Ming Xian be female?
-Exactly.

00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:36.784
Sinner Ming Xian!

00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:38.665
You defected from Yaoguang Mountain,

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:41.185
and yet you still have
the audacity to interrupt my investiture?

00:34:42.824 --> 00:34:43.945
Very well.

00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:46.865
Today, before everyone,

00:34:46.945 --> 00:34:48.505
I will expose your true identity!

00:34:51.945 --> 00:34:53.025
Father,

00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:55.344
the evidence is undeniable.

00:34:55.425 --> 00:34:57.185
Even if the Empress refuses to admit it,

00:34:57.265 --> 00:34:59.465
the truth is already before us.

00:35:00.585 --> 00:35:02.185
Back then, the Empress, Jing Shu,

00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:04.905
used an infant girl to
impersonate the Crown Prince!

00:35:05.745 --> 00:35:07.625
-What?
-She did?

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.025
How dare she?

00:35:09.105 --> 00:35:10.945
Is this true?

00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:13.305
-Unbelievable!
-How could that be?

00:35:24.985 --> 00:35:27.025
Lord Chengyun is right.

00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:28.465
I am indeed a fairy.

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:31.705
Years ago, the Empress defied
the laws and practiced immortal arts,

00:35:31.785 --> 00:35:34.665
disguising me as a male immortal to take
the real Crown Prince's place.

00:35:35.465 --> 00:35:37.665
-She actually did that?
-How could this happen?

00:35:41.745 --> 00:35:45.025
You deceived His Majesty. What audacity.

00:35:46.305 --> 00:35:47.145
Your Majesty,

00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:50.585
if it became known
that this jinx impersonated

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:52.345
the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

00:35:52.425 --> 00:35:54.625
and fought in the Qingyun Tournament

00:35:54.705 --> 00:35:56.785
for eight consecutive
years, wouldn't it make

00:35:57.345 --> 00:35:59.465
Yaoguang Mountain a laughingstock?

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:02.625
Naming Ming Xin Crown Prince today will be

00:36:02.705 --> 00:36:04.065
what truly makes
Yaoguang Mountain a laughingstock.

00:36:10.825 --> 00:36:12.345
In my hand is the Recording Mirror.

00:36:12.425 --> 00:36:16.545
It holds proof of
Ming Xin's collusion with other realms.

00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:20.465
He took the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:22.985
and poisoned me
before the Qingyun Tournament,

00:36:23.065 --> 00:36:24.425
causing Yaoguang Mountain's defeat.

00:36:28.585 --> 00:36:29.825
Here's the Heavenly Grief you need.

00:36:29.905 --> 00:36:31.305
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

00:36:31.945 --> 00:36:33.305
With this Heavenly Grief,

00:36:33.865 --> 00:36:34.945
Ming Xian

00:36:35.465 --> 00:36:38.745
will no longer be
the Warrior God of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:36:42.145 --> 00:36:45.545
Now, he has become
a pawn of Zhushui Spiritual State

00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:49.665
and even schemes to have
the Emperor of Zhushui help him

00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:51.465
secure the Crown Prince's seat.

00:36:51.545 --> 00:36:53.985
If we allow Ming Xin to
show a wolf into the house,

00:36:54.785 --> 00:36:58.065
who is to say
the Emperor of Zhushui will not divide

00:36:58.145 --> 00:36:59.665
and devour
Yaoguang Mountain piece by piece?

00:37:01.225 --> 00:37:02.065
Your Majesty,

00:37:02.145 --> 00:37:05.065
Ming Xin did everything for you
and for Yaoguang Mountain.

00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:08.185
Please don't be swayed
by the one-sided words of this jinx

00:37:08.265 --> 00:37:10.105
and leave Yaoguang Mountain
without a Crown Prince.

00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.265
Besides,

00:37:12.825 --> 00:37:16.185
whose blood runs in this fairy's veins

00:37:16.265 --> 00:37:17.825
remains to be verified, doesn't it?

00:37:25.825 --> 00:37:27.985
Who I am no longer matters.

00:37:29.105 --> 00:37:30.185
I came here today

00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:32.425
to help Yaoguang Mountain

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:36.945
welcome back its true Crown Prince.

00:37:42.065 --> 00:37:42.905
What do you mean?

00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:48.665
Lord Chengyun,

00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:51.105
what you said earlier was only half true.

00:37:53.065 --> 00:37:55.385
Back then, after
the Empress gave birth to her son,

00:37:55.465 --> 00:37:57.385
she discovered
that he had no spiritual veins.

00:37:57.465 --> 00:37:58.825
So she found another child

00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:00.425
born on the same day
within the Yaoguang Palace

00:38:00.505 --> 00:38:01.185
and secretly switched them.

00:38:02.545 --> 00:38:04.065
The real Crown Prince

00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:06.345
was kidnapped by
bandits on his way to the border

00:38:06.865 --> 00:38:08.145
of Yaoguang Mountain

00:38:08.705 --> 00:38:10.465
and ended up in
the Sunken Abyss of Jixing.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.945
There, he suffered endless torment

00:38:14.905 --> 00:38:16.545
and was afflicted with the Heavenly Grief,

00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:19.025
which later awakened
spiritual veins within him.

00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:21.305
His spiritual veins
were formed after birth?

00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:26.225
Then that man is the real Crown Prince!

00:38:26.305 --> 00:38:28.625
Right!

00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:31.585
Then who is that child?

00:38:54.025 --> 00:38:55.025
Ji Bozai?

00:38:55.105 --> 00:38:57.345
Yes. What is he doing here?

00:38:57.425 --> 00:38:58.665
-Ji Bozai?
-He's here too?

00:38:58.745 --> 00:39:00.465
Why is he here?

00:39:00.545 --> 00:39:02.665
What is his relation to Ming Xian?

00:39:13.025 --> 00:39:13.865
Your Majesty.

00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:15.985
Your Majesty!

00:39:31.425 --> 00:39:32.265
Are you truly…?

00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:35.545
Before sending the child away,

00:39:36.065 --> 00:39:37.265
the Empress left a mark

00:39:37.785 --> 00:39:39.345
between his brows with her own blood.

00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:45.545
-How can that be proven?
-Yes.

00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:46.585
Is it really him?

00:39:52.425 --> 00:39:53.785
-Is he really…?
-It really is him!

00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:55.225
It's him!

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.145
Nonsense!

00:40:02.865 --> 00:40:05.665
You two conspired to deceive His Majesty

00:40:05.745 --> 00:40:06.585
just to stop me

00:40:06.665 --> 00:40:09.585
from becoming
Yaoguang Mountain's Crown Prince!

00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:13.625
-Xin…
-On the basis of a single mark,

00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:16.185
you claim Ji Bozai is
the true Crown Prince?

00:40:16.745 --> 00:40:18.425
How utterly ridiculous!

00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:24.465
If my father, She Tianlin, testifies,

00:40:24.545 --> 00:40:26.465
might that prove it?

00:40:29.225 --> 00:40:31.785
Before Your Majesty, I would not dare lie.

00:40:32.465 --> 00:40:34.665
Ji Bozai is indeed the Empress's son,

00:40:36.385 --> 00:40:40.065
while Ming Xian is
the child of me and a physician.

00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:43.945
All right.

00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:46.345
Everything is clear now.

00:40:47.465 --> 00:40:50.585
Yaoguang Mountain has at
last seen its true Crown Prince.

00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:56.345
Shall we proceed with
the investiture ceremony?

00:40:58.905 --> 00:41:00.265
Ming Xian!

00:41:02.465 --> 00:41:03.145
Xin!

00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.265
Xin.

00:41:17.385 --> 00:41:18.345
Your Majesty.

00:41:20.065 --> 00:41:21.065
Your Majesty,

00:41:21.825 --> 00:41:24.785
for the sake of
the years you've shared with Xin,

00:41:25.785 --> 00:41:26.985
please spare him this once.

00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:32.225
Ming Xin and his mother
colluded with Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.985
The evidence is conclusive.
They shall face the Ultimate Punishment!

00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:44.705
Your Majesty,
this has nothing to do with Xin.

00:41:45.465 --> 00:41:47.745
It was all my fault.

00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:49.945
He knew nothing.

00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:52.545
Let me take the punishment instead.

00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:55.145
He is your flesh and blood.

00:41:56.145 --> 00:41:59.785
I beg you, spare him this once.

00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.625
As his mother,

00:42:02.505 --> 00:42:04.945
were you truly
unaware of your son's deeds?

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:08.305
How dare you plead for him before me?

00:42:08.385 --> 00:42:09.625
That Recording Mirror

00:42:10.425 --> 00:42:12.785
holds solid evidence
of Ming Xin's involvement.

00:42:14.145 --> 00:42:15.185
Wretch!

00:42:17.985 --> 00:42:20.105
-Seize them both!
-Yes!

00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:31.865
As for the Empress of Yaoguang,

00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:33.385
strip her of rank at once.

00:42:34.545 --> 00:42:35.625
Since she is
the Crown Prince's birth mother,

00:42:35.705 --> 00:42:36.905
she shall not be executed.

00:42:36.985 --> 00:42:38.585
Confine her to the palace for now.

00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:40.145
I will decide her fate later.

00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:42.625
As for She Tianlin and Ming Yi,

00:42:43.225 --> 00:42:44.665
they deceived all of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:46.425
Their crimes are unforgivable.

00:42:46.505 --> 00:42:49.625
She Tianlin shall face
the Thunder Punishment,

00:42:50.305 --> 00:42:52.585
and Ming Yi shall be
stripped of her spiritual veins

00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:54.025
and banished from the realm.

00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:55.905
-Guards!
-Yes!

00:42:55.985 --> 00:42:57.425
Seize them!

00:42:58.465 --> 00:42:59.305
Wait.

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.185
Why not let the two of them go?

00:43:02.945 --> 00:43:05.785
Now that I have returned,
punishing them seems pointless.

00:43:06.385 --> 00:43:07.265
No.

00:43:08.225 --> 00:43:10.865
If we let them go,
how can we command respect?

00:43:10.945 --> 00:43:13.385
We cannot show mercy just because she once

00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:14.865
stood as Crown Prince.

00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:18.425
Besides, Ming Yi has
immense spiritual power.

00:43:18.505 --> 00:43:20.305
We cannot risk her fleeing to the enemy.

00:43:21.225 --> 00:43:23.825
For the welfare of
Yaoguang Mountain and its people,

00:43:25.105 --> 00:43:26.545
I have no choice but
to make such decisions.

00:43:27.985 --> 00:43:29.425
Seize them both!

00:43:29.505 --> 00:43:30.465
Yes!

00:43:30.545 --> 00:43:31.785
Stop!

00:43:34.065 --> 00:43:35.585
How dare you resist?
