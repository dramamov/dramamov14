WEBVTT

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.200
Brother

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200
We're back again.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520
That's awesome.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
That's why you're our big brother.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.320
You casually won such a big prize.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.519
Not only did we not spend a penny,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.519
but we also got free food and accommodation.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.320
Recently,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.240
our project has been going well.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.440
This is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.000
heaven rewarding us.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.600
Thank you, brother.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.360
Let's use water instead of alcohol

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.289
and have a drink.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.440
Alright, cheers.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.200
Great!

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.760
Conquering Death Mountain once again.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.800
Life is but a few short autumns.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
We won't stop until we're drunk.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.039
My beauty over there.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.120
Give it a rest.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200
Call me when we arrive.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.560
Sure thing.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.800
Qu Feiyu.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.720
I confess.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.720
So you admit

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.100
that you killed those four people

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
and uploaded that video online?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.760
I admit it.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.200
Don't be so quick to take the blame.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.730
Forgive me for being blunt,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.200
but you're blind.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.770
It would be difficult for you to do all this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.660
by yourself, wouldn't it?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.900
Indeed, it was difficult.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.690
Who's your accomplice?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.320
Though I can't see her face,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.040
from her voice,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760
she must be as beautiful

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.200
as you are.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.840
Fox.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.360
So you've already found out.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.600
That's right.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000
She said she enjoys hunting,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.560
especially hunting foxes,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920
so she asked me to call her Fox.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320
How did Fox help you carry out your revenge?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
Tell us in detail how you planned it.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.020
I'm being so cooperative.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.760
Aren't you afraid I might be lying?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.560
Would you lie?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.400
Whether covering for the fox

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.000
or trying to exonerate yourself,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.860
you haven't succeeded at either.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.240
You were asking questions you already knew the answers to.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.040
In that case,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.700
I don't seem to have any reason to lie.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.360
Qu Feiyu.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.000
You weren't actually brainwashed by the fox.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.040
The lowest point of your life when you lost your sight

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040
has forged you into someone more decisive

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.300
and resilient inside.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.520
To be honest,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.040
I was quite nervous before coming to see you.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.760
Because all the details indicate

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.280
that ordinary interrogation methods

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.600
would hardly break through your psychological defenses.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.360
But now I feel much more at ease

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.320
and relieved.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.000
Because you've chosen to cooperate with us

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.930
instead of resisting till the end.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.480
Actually, for me,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.690
it makes no difference.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.530
As long as we can clear the false accusations against us,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.640
that's enough.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.280
I didn't have much desire to live anyway.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.780
Getting caught

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960
is just another way to die.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.320
To avenge Zhao Shengqian,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.380
you became a murderer.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.140
Was it worth it?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.480
At that time,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.360
I have bipolar disorder.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.400
At my worst episodes,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.520
it was Qian

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.000
who helped me survive.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.920
Watch out!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.440
Are you okay?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.880
They're like family to me.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.370
Their family-like atmosphere touched me

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.040
and gave my life meaning again.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.120
So,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.200
I decided to join them.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.600
Captain,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.520
do we still need more people in our rescue team?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.000
I want to join.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.600
Alright.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.640
Then welcome Qu Feiyu

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.120
to our rescue team.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.880
Thank you, Captain.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.960
Let's have a toast.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.160
Great, welcome!

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.800
Thank you.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.520
Welcome.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.840
But

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.480
Five years ago

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.840
that night when you and Zhao Shengqian went up the mountain for rescue,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.800
four people led by Yao Lixing

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.280
stole your supplies.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.120
From that moment on,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.160
it completely destroyed your hope for life.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.960
Right?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.480
That day

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.600
it was raining.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.840
While searching for them,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.120
my brother Qian and I were already injured to varying degrees.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.480
By the time we found those four scumbags,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.880
they had no supplies left.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.610
We barely kept them alive with what little we had.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.360
Though the rain had stopped,

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.080
it was already dark.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.720
The path down the mountain was very difficult to find.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.320
Suffering from hunger and cold,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.640
Qian decided to stop and take a rest.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.180
As the rescue team leader,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.720
you should know

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.480
one less person means one less burden.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840
This little food

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760
isn't enough for anyone.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.600
Everything on you,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600
in your bags,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.250
hand it all over now!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.520
Number Three,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.280
go!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.490
Hand it over!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.000
Stop!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.600
What are you doing?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.159
Hand it over!

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.920
What are you doing?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.720
Let go!

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.720
Heaven sees

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.080
what you do.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.240
I'm here to save you.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.700
Without us locals from Yuji Town,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.880
none of you will make it out of Death Mountain alive.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.360
Go to hell!

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.440
Give it to me!

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.680
I told you not to move!

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.760
Let her go!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.320
Captain Zhao!

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.720
But I never expected

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.360
they would push Qian off the cliff.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.680
Everyone saw it.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.080
He fell down by himself.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.970
It has nothing to do with us.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.760
Nothing at all.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.600
Pack up quickly.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.680
Take everything.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.320
Hurry!

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.960
Okay.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.320
Give me that hat.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.440
I said give me that hat!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.320
What are you looking at?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.120
Get moving!

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.800
Let's go!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.120
Captain Zhao!

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.800
Captain Zhao!

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
Captain Zhao!

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.360
Captain Zhao!

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.360
I wanted to save him then.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.960
Then I realized

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.320
I couldn't even take care of myself.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.720
When I woke up again,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.760
it was three months later.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880
I contacted journalists

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.120
hoping to clear up the truth.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.760
But the story had already gone cold,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.560
nobody cared anymore.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.440
If

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.240
your initial goal was revenge,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.440
you wouldn't have waited five years.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.240
That's true.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.640
At first, I just wanted to clear up the truth.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.210
After all, if it weren't for Brother Qian,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400
I probably would have died long ago.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.640
I promised him

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.440
I would live well.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.840
But my illness

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.920
got worse day by day.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.520
I thought about suicide more than once.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.800
I was really afraid that one day

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.039
I wouldn't be able to hold on anymore.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.799
While those four scumbags were still out there.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.960
And that's when

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.880
Fox found you.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.059
She said she could avenge you,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.140
help you kill them.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.160
Although you couldn't quite believe it,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.220
you couldn't resist the temptation.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.600
Because she knew everything about what happened to you

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.680
and was confident she wouldn't be caught by the police.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.520
So you proposed

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.960
creating a low-temperature environment on Death Mountain,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.760
frightening

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.720
and oxygen-deprived conditions.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.760
To achieve your revenge against them,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.000
a kind of ritual.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.440
She agreed.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.240
That's right.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.170
Everything is just as you said.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.120
So I cooperated fully with her plan.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.480
We set up the location first.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.600
Then

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.960
you posted fake adventure information

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.360
to lure them into the tour group.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.320
And on the bus, you gave them

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.180
water laced with sleeping pills.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.720
When they woke up,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.520
they had been abandoned in a deserted house.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.800
We are guilty.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.300
These four characters

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.660
were deliberately carved on the victims by you, weren't they?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.000
They are unforgivable.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.680
Xiong Jing's body

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.880
was placed in a predetermined location by you.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.320
The purpose of doing this

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.810
was to frighten Yao Lixing and the others.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.960
Stop!

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.640
Help!

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.120
Don't run!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.920
Help me!

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.160
Stop running!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.890
Please help!

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.240
Save me!

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.280
Hurry!

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.320
Help!

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.960
It was also a targeted revenge

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.560
for her standing by and doing nothing back then.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.360
That's right.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.640
At that time,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.360
although she didn't participate in looting supplies,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.200
but

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.000
if she had just, after coming down the mountain,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.760
told the rescue team about our situation and Brother Qian's,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.420
Brother Qian wouldn't have died so tragically.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.360
So

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.640
she had to die too.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.540
Tape recorder.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.160
Pulley.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.080
And other crime evidence at the scene.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.570
After the incident,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.360
did you move anything?

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.760
Did Fox tell you

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.880
or contact you?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.000
No.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.000
After I was taken down from the mountain,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I don't know

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.600
what happened next.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.640
I never saw her again.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.800
Why did you bring in extra sculptures

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.260
to make it exactly twelve?

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.440
Why was the video release time

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.080
set at 25 minutes?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.720
Fox demanded it.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.600
As for the specific reason,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.920
I have no idea why.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.640
Is there any evidence

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.940
that proves you worked together?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.680
No.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.680
She was confident the police wouldn't find her.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.370
And that's exactly what happened.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.360
You only know what she did,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.040
but you can't

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.900
find evidence to convict her.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.520
East E·80090.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.320
East F·80090.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.760
At least last time she left a photo.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.410
This time she covered her tracks completely.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.360
This fox is quite clever.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.640
But we've made progress.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.840
We figured out her crime pattern early.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.880
Next time we'll set the trap in advance.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.920
Let the fox feel what it's like to be hunted.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.400
Just tell me what's bothering you.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.600
Don't push yourself.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.530
I'm thinking...

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.760
Looking at these recent cases,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.090
if the Fox hadn't been manipulating things from behind,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.760
those killers

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.300
might have feared justice would prevail

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.320
and wouldn't have had the courage to commit murder.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.880
Without the Fox's help,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.610
they would've lacked the ability to plan these murders.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.920
Those victims

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.050
wouldn't have died so tragically.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.860
You're not suggesting

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.120
that it was because of the Fox's

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.520
specific targeting and provocation of you

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.400
that caused those killers

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.810
to take that final step?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.160
I think so.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.280
In a way,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.480
I indirectly contributed to

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080
these tragedies happening.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.120
I brought this upon them.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.970
You feel guilty.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.690
I'm not joking with you.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.840
I increasingly feel that

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.410
the fox's provocations

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.000
must have some kind of

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.680
specific purpose.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.360
She might know about my past.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.680
It's just that

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.880
she's hiding in the darkness.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.840
I can't see her

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.080
or find any connection.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.040
And these numbers.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.720
What does 25 really mean?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.900
12 can't be a coincidence either.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.320
What I've lost is

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.120
my memories from before I was 12.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.300
So is this number 12

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.280
related to my memory loss?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.220
I think you're carrying too much mental burden.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.020
Don't see yourself as an accomplice to evil.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400
In my eyes,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.480
you're also a victim.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.340
If you really blame yourself,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.050
You should pull yourself together now

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.840
and catch that fox

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.400
and those rats and whatever else

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.860
and bring them to justice.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.040
As for those numbers,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.560
there's no pattern yet.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.810
Sometimes it's age,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.400
sometimes jersey numbers,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.760
and sometimes timestamps.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.020
No matter what this fox

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.680
is really after,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.120
once we catch the person,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.580
we'll naturally find out.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.520
Let's go.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.020
Let's head back early.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.570
Alright, get some rest.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.040
You can't even seize the opportunities given to you.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.840
You're still the same as before,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.160
so boring.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.920
A fake is just a fake.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.840
Even if you kill me,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.520
you fake fox,

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.380
you'll never become the real one.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.000
It is you after all.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So easy to trick.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.640
I remember when you used to fight back,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.240
weren't you quite decisive?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.730
I was just thinking,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.000
no matter how convincing your act is,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.800
the insecurity and jealousy in your bones

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.930
can never be hidden.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.040
You couldn't beat me before.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.240
Don't even think about it in the future.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.920
Chi Xia.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.359
Chi Xia.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.839
Are you okay?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.640
Quick, go after it.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.359
It's a fox.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.120
Secretly doing business with Tu Guolin behind my back.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.780
I really underestimated you.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.400
I suspect I've actually killed someone before.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.600
Whether you resent it

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.800
or hate it,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.840
pull it out with your own hands.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.520
Don't move!

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.560
Police!

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.090
Get down!

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.360
That old friend of yours at the police station

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.720
has something I want.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.280
What to do

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.360
Is that clear?
